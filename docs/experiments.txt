- Train on clinical, test on clinical (Question: Can we reproduce fraser?)
    - First experiment:
        - All features, report 10-fold cross validation and 70%, 30%
    - Second experiment
        - Feature subsets
            - Size = 35 - 50
            - Use fraser to guide which features we use
- Train on nonclinical + clinical, test on non-clinical + clinical (Question: Can we improve fraser)
    - First experiment:
        - All features, report 10-fold cross validation and 70%, 30%
    - Second experiment
        - Feature subsets
            - Size = 35 - 50
