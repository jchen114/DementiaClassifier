- For optima concatenated all text without adding sentence breaks
- For imagability, familarity, and concreteness we used data from here: http://www.psych.rl.ac.uk/MRC_Psych_Db.html
- imagability, familarity, and concreteness scores currently use 0 for unrecognized words (do we want to use some small non-zero number?)
    - Currently normalizing by by total number of words in sentence
    - Currently including stopwords but maybe should take them out first?
- Age of acquisition words come from this paper:

- Cosine similarity between utterances returns zero if one string consists only of stopwords
- In the feature 'Phrase type rate' we use non-embedded counts of phrase types but the paper doesn't say which version is used
