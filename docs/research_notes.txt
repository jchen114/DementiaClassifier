- For optima concatenated all text without adding sentence breaks
- For imagability, familarity, and concreteness we used data from here: http://www.psych.rl.ac.uk/MRC_Psych_Db.html
- imagability, familarity, and concreteness scores currently use 0 for unrecognized words (do we want to use some small non-zero number?)
    - Currently normalizing by by total number of words in sentence
    - Currently including stopwords but maybe should take them out first?
- Age of acquisition words come from this paper:
    + http://crr.ugent.be/papers/Kuperman%20et%20al%20AoA%20ratings.pdf
    + 
- Fraser paper kept utterances separate but we have collapsed all utterences into one paragraph. Should change 
- Might want to use Jacob's library for some of the summary statistics on the utterances (MSL etc.)
- Have to find a good value for the hyperparameter 'window size' in the feature MATTR
- Few grammatical concerns for the POS tag count that should be checked, see red highlighted text in google dod
- Cosine similarity between utterances returns zero if one string consists only of stopwords
- In the feature 'Phrase type rate' we use non-embedded counts of phrase types but the paper doesn't say which version is used
- Please delete 255EG_363a_7.txt in data/processed/optima/nometa/control and run the parser to create the pickles again

- Each utterance contains a multiple trees. Normalize tree features by number of nodes in each tree or normalize by total number of nodes in the utterance? We chose the latter.
- How do we normalize PProportion?
- Here are the feature dicts we used:
