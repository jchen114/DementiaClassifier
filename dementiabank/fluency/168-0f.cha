*INV:	begin now .
*PAR:	dog cats &um horses &uh cows .
*INV:	that's right .
*PAR:	sheeps [* m:+s] .
*INV:	okay now let's try something a little different .
*INV:	I want you to think of as many words beginning with the letter f@l .
*INV:	the only thing here is that it can't be a proper name or place
	like France or Fred .
*INV:	it also can't be a derivative like run runner or running would all
	be counted as one word .
*INV:	so as many words as you can think of starting with the letter f@l as
	you can think of and you can begin now .
*PAR:	like a fish &uh .
