	letter s@l .
*INV:	any word at all that begins with the letter s@l .
*INV:	now let me give you some examples of what you can do what I don't
	want you to do is to think of a word that is a proper name or place .
*INV:	for example if we were using the letter f@l something like France or
	Fred they wouldn't count because they are proper names .
*INV:	same thing with derivatives for example run runner and running using
	the letter r@l well they'd all be counted as one word .

	you can begin now .
