  Life
 It is what happens to us while we are busy pursuing all of our best-laid plans for the future
 In, Kevin Garrison shares with us a look into his own life, showing how circumstances shaped his future as a young man and ultimately led him to a lifelong career of helping others
 Kevin lets us see close up from his personal perspective what it is like to face uncertainty, rejection, emotional and physical pain, and even loss
 But he also shares a story of love, support, close friendships, and determination
 Most important, though, we are reminded through his story that life presents us with a series of choices
 Often, these choices come in the form of challenges, and with every choice made, consequences follow
 Sometimes the consequences are good; sometimes they are not so good
 Kevin takes us along on his personal journey as he confronts difficult decisions and adversity as a youth
 In learning to deal with his own challenges, he gained an appreciation of the challenges of others, which clearly helped to shape him into the professional and the man he is today
 Kevin and I, as it turns out, have a lot in common
 We both grew up in a kind of middle-American lifestyle: Kevin in El Paso, Texas, and me (from fourth grade through high school) in Hartland, Wisconsin
 Both of us found our careers (or they found us) at a relatively young age
 Both of us "apprenticed" for a time in our field before going to get our formal professional educations
 Ironically,  we both got our prosthetics training at Northwestern University in Chicago
 We both also lived for a while in California, he while at UCLA and I while getting my degrees in prosthetics and orthotics and health administration
 I also served my orthotic internship at Rancho Los Amigos Rehabilitation Hospital in Downey, California, staying on afterward to teach in the internship and residency programs and to do research
 Both Kevin and I also worked for several private practices before eventually starting our own, his in Florida and mine in Texas
 Lots of similarities, to be sure
 But probably the most significant thing we share is what got each of us into our profession: a physical challenge
 Kevin and I do not have the same disabilities or age of onset
 My challenge came in the form of polio, a disease that is almost unheard of now
 In fact, when I contracted it at the age of nine months, it was of epidemic proportion and was commonly called "infantile paralysis" because it primarily attacked infants and left them paralyzed to varying degrees
 In my case, it left me with a completely paralyzed left leg and a partially paralyzed right leg
 Because of this, I wear a brace (orthosis) that extends from my hip to the tip of my toes on my left leg
 Without it, I cannot take a step, but I must admit that I haven't always appreciated having it
 I can tell you for sure that growing up "different" can be tough
 When I was growing up in Hartland, it was a town of approximately , people
 It was kind of like a northern version of Andy Griffith's Mayberry RFD, where everybody knew everybody
 Man, I stuck out like a sore thumb
 Thinking back, I can't even remember knowing any ugly people in Hartland, let alone anyone else with a disability
 I also recall that crutches and a brace, despite their metallic properties, did not actually function particularly well as "chick magnets" (though luckily my "magnetic" personality did help some)
 While I was still quite young and planning on a career in radio broadcasting, life happened
 It happened in the form of me designing my own brace and having it made to my specifications by  an orthotist named Dean Morfey, C
 To his great credit, he was open to the ideas of a young man who had no expertise whatsoever other than just being a longtime wearer of a brace
 He quoted me a price and provided only one caveat: "I'll make it the way you want, but if you don't like the way it turns out, don't come back here complaining about it
" With his skills and my ideas, he made me a brace that changed my life
 It was so superior to anything I had had before that I began thinking perhaps I should go into this field instead of radio broadcasting
 The decision to do that opened the door to a career that has allowed me to travel and lecture nationally and internationally, author scientific articles and papers, serve on state and national boards, and set up and direct through its first five years the Prosthetics-Orthotics Program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas
 My teachers at Arrowhead High School in Hartland would never have believed it! In any profession (as in life) you get the most when you give the most
 Giving back means taking the time to share your knowledge, expertise, and experience with others
 Kevin has taken the time to do just that
 This book is an encouragement to all who read it
 It can serve as a source of inspiration for students looking to make a career choice or for those young practitioners who have just entered the profession and are beginning their residencies
 Experienced practitioners can also reflect upon their journeys into the field by reading Kevin's story
 It is an insightful, touching, humorous, and honest look into one man's life and how he turned adversity into triumph
 Choices? He made plenty, both good and bad, and he shares them all honestly and openly in
 So read, relax, and enjoy this story about a man, his challenges, and his dream
 Bruce "Mac" McClellan, CPO, LPO, FISPO President American Academy of Orthotists & Prosthetists  I feel that the human being is a remarkable biological combination of cells, resulting in masterpieces of development--you and me! I am sure the greatest thinkers of our rich past contemplated on a regular basis the remarkable abilities they found in themselves as well as those around them
 The things we take for granted each day that come to us so easily just cannot be accomplished by all the inhabitants of our beautiful planet individually
 We have in us the ability to adapt to any situation or specific goal when given the time and opportunity to study our new circumstances of life, should they suddenly change
 We can then slowly adjust if we choose to
 All of us can adapt to a change of climate relating to the intense physical exertion of our bodies
 Artistic control of our wrists, hands, and fingers for musical instruments and paintbrushes can also be accomplished over time
 Coordination of all our limbs for managing machinery of all types and even great sporting activities can also be accomplished with repetitive effort and determination
 We can achieve our goals if we choose to adapt and then follow through by maintaining this determination, which is necessary for success and, in some cases, downright survival
 It can be done!   The story I share in this book focuses on my personal inner feelings and conflict
 It spans the years from  through , touching on some years before and some years after this troubled time in my life
 I discovered many things during this period, especially what was important for me to hang onto for my future and, more important, what I should strive to let go of
 I wrote this book for several reasons, but primarily because I wanted to help the reader develop a special understanding of what the words permanent disability really mean
 I chose to write my story after having had an opportunity to grow a bit older and become a bit wiser about the ways of the world, so to speak
 Having a more mature understanding in my fifties of what I went through as a teenager, and living as an amputee for more than thirty years, gave me a profound insight to draw from
 I could now focus on what was truly relevant to emphasize in my story and what was not
 Working as a prosthetist providing prosthetic limbs for amputees for more than thirty years was invaluable as well
 As time passed, I really understood the harsh times I went through in my youth, and I related my personal experience to that of other amputees
 I was able to provide valuable insight for clinicians, specifically, professionals involved in providing health care for those with permanent disabilities
 This was something I felt quite passionate about, and I knew it was worthy and important to bring out in my story
 The help of family and friends is very important and often overlooked, so I wrote about how they impressed upon me their interest and love, and how they ultimately contributed to my future well-being as I went through this very challenging time in my life
 They were all a very powerful force behind my struggles, helping me find my way back into my life as I had once known it
 The four pictures I include highlight this great, interesting, and ever-changing prosthetics profession from the past, specifically 
 I also thought that including the five unique sketches made in ­ would add a fun and interesting element for the reader to discover as well
 I have to add that my good friend Richard Winer, an established author of ten books (one, The Devil's Triangle,  a best seller) helped me with this decision one afternoon
 "Kevin, you have to put pictures in your book!" he sternly advised
 I was questioning him about the development of my book, and as usual, it was good advice coming from Dick
 My wife, Catheline (Cate), wrote the prologue
 She felt compelled to contribute to the telling of my story in this way
 As an attorney and a well-seasoned occupational therapist practicing for more than thirty years, Cate has had ample opportunity to witness the real struggle to survive with which those with permanent disabilities are tasked every day
 My beautiful wife (my sexy angel with long hair) shares my deep conviction of the importance of offering hope in the telling of my story and presenting it in a most helpful and meaningful way
 I am sure you will enjoy reading the prologue as Cate sets the tone for my life story
 I shared my story because I firmly believe that humans are very strong beings, both physically and mentally
 To me, the fact that we still exist is in itself a testament to that belief
 As humans, we are, unfortunately, subjected to all forms of potential damage to our health during our lives
 Physical and mental problems can occur through disease or traumatic accidents, as well as warfare and aging
 It's just our basic natural human frailties and imperfections reacting to the challenges that life can bring, and the risks we all take every day, that allow us to get hurt or to possibly become permanently disabled
 If we become disabled, we must embrace our disability with this fantastic unique inner strength that we all possess within us
 Using the genuine acceptance of our fate, we can begin to truly live out our days to the fullest, as we all deserve
 Enjoy your gift of life to the fullest!  "Where is the guest list?" asked Sophia, the young, talented woman we had hired to help us plan a joyous celebration
 The party was to be in honor of Kevin's thirtieth anniversary of his prosthetics career
 As we sat around the coffee table, Sophia continued to ask questions about the menu, guest attire, flower arrangements, and flamenco music, Kevin's favorite
 I couldn't help glancing across the family room and catching Kevin's profound look as he stared at the simple yet elegant party invitation Sophia and I had created
 Sophia and I had been working on this event for many weeks
 I wanted to make absolutely sure the theme of the party reflected the joyous nature of this splendid occasion for Kevin as well as our family and friends
 We carefully reviewed the verbiage on the invitation, ensuring it fully expressed the details of the celebration
 We also made sure there were no errors in the printing
 We carefully checked and rechecked every detail
 Oh, the details! The evening is going to be perfect, I kept saying to myself
 When we first met, I had told Sophia that this party we were planning was about a very special accomplishment in our lives as a family
 We wanted to celebrate and to give thanks and honor to many of our patients, friends, and family members who had trusted xix  and embraced Kevin and me in our quest to assist amputees
 I especially wanted Kevin to know how proud I am of him
 I am proud of his perseverance and determination to follow his dreams no matter what
 As I fidgeted with the papers she had just handed me, Sophia kept reminding me that the celebration was less than three weeks away
 So many details, so little time, Sophia kept saying, as she looked over the music contract and repertoire of Kevin's favorite flamenco music
 I couldn't help noticing from a distance his distinctive and very familiar change in posture
 As I speculated about why his demeanor seemed to gradually change, Kevin continued to sip on his first cup of freshly brewed Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee
 He loved his coffee: two cups in the early morning savored slowly
 I watched him as he contemplated Mother Nature at her best; he gazed at the combinations of colorful saltwater fish in our aquarium
 Watching him enjoy the playful nature of our four Maine Coon cats as they came to sit with him while he continued to take pleasure in his coffee was my special delight
 The cooing of Rosie and Poncho, our colorful Macaw parrots, is the background music of the early morning in our home
 Mother Nature really speaks to you in Florida, especially in our backyard as the sun comes up
 We enjoy the peaceful view out our windows, gazing at all the lush variations of green, from the darkest shades of the palm fronds to the lightest tropical, feathery plant leaves
 During most of the year we enjoy all the vibrant flowering hibiscus and bougainvillea plants of yellow, pink, and deep purple
 This morning was different
 I couldn't help but notice the subtle tilting of Kevin's head and the nervous movements of his foot as he crossed it over his leg
 He held the ivory-colored party invitation with beautiful, flowing gold script lettering very carefully with his right hand, as if to seriously review it
 Yet I felt his thoughts were elsewhere
 I put the papers that were in my hand down on the table, leaving Sophia as she mumbled some indistinguishable words under her breath
 I walked over to my beloved husband
 I moved slowly past the cozy chenille sectional sofa in the family room and xx  then toward the warm and inviting breakfast nook where he was sitting quietly
 The morning sunlight washed the walls with hues of amber; the expansive lake view was serene and spectacular this early morning
 The fresh coffee aroma continued to fill the air
 Our four dogs, which completed our children, ran playfully in our backyard, chasing one another as I viewed them
 "Kevin," I said
 "Do you like it?" I didn't let him answer before I nervously asked him again, this time with greater excitement
 "Isn't it perfect?" There was a quiet moment
 As he turned to look at me, I noticed his normally stoic face had changed to a definite expression of what I would call the look of gentle contentment
 His brown, somewhat tired, watery eyes had a kind of sparkle to them as he began to smile modestly
 I saw a tear falling from his cheek
 He sat, saying no words, yet I knew what his silent words were as if he were softly speaking them out loud to me
 The words describing his story flashed in front of me: his life, our life, and our destiny together
 In that moment I thought of this bright, strong, athletic teenaged boy who lost his most precious possessions: his right foot, his body image, his balance
 Yet I know for a fact he had never lost his dreams
 I was startled, yet I did feel at peace when I heard my husband say, "Perfect, Catheline, it is perfect
"   I just wanted to leave that tiny claustrophobic exam room
 Surely if I just left, everything would go back to normal
 Those horrible words with their gruesome image would go away
 "We feel you have a ninety-five percent chance of having your right foot amputated due to the reoccurrence of the tumor
" I tipped my head back and looked at the bright lights above, shocked into silence in a way that I had never experienced before
 Tears quickly began to well in the corners of my eyes
 The pit of my stomach tightened, and I almost shook with emotion
 I thought, I am not dealing with this
 I am not going to come back to this hospital
 At that, I started feeling a tiny bit more in control
 How can this be happening to me? I wished so much that my mother was with me
 I felt so alone
 I was a teenager in the summer of , and the summer heat baked the streets of El Paso, Texas, cooking the tar in the road until it began to bubble
 The brown grass yearned for the cooling rains
 When the rains finally came, the grass grew lush and green, creating summer fun for my friends and me
 We treasured the rain and the simple pleasures it brought
   When the rains came, we would run to the park and watch as the water came slithering down from the top of the majestic, light brown, rain-soaked mountain, forming a pool on the playing fields
 My friends and I would take our shoes off and run as fast as we possibly could, jumping and sliding, hydroplaning over the thick, dark green grass, falling, rolling, and getting soaking wet
 I will never forget the sweet smell of the wet grass in the park, inhaling it with my nose close to the ground, the air heavy with the scent of the wet desert sand surrounding us, saturated like musk
 It was wonderful
 One day I ran and jumped and slid, but my life began to change and spin way out of my control
 I was exhausted that day, stopping only after smacking my right foot into a small flat rock just under the water's surface
 I sat down and saw that the toe next to my big toe was swollen
 I'll tell you it hurt like hell, but of course I had to hide that from my friends
 After all, we were only sixteen years old and very tough
 When the initial pain subsided, I pretended that I had to get home
 I walked the one block home, looking forward to resting in my bedroom
 I studied my toe for the next few days and learned to walk in such a way that it didn't hurt too much
 However, whenever I forgot, my toe eagerly reminded me with a shooting pain
 I came to the conclusion over time that I had broken the bone that attaches the toe to the foot, because it stayed swollen
 The swelling remained even after it finally stopped hurting
 However, being sixteen, I ignored my swollen toe
 There were so many things that were more interesting
 The desert, for one
 It was so intriguing, containing so much nature just down at the end of our street
 My friends and I often went on all-day hiking trips
 We would look for fossils of ancient ocean animals that had died millions of years ago
 Most often we only stumbled upon faded, colored pieces of broken Indian pottery hundreds of years old
 Holding those bits of history in my hand was a wild experience for me
 I felt a physical connection to life in the near and far past
 Exploring the desert was something I enjoyed very much and arranged to do often
   The desert sounds of grasshoppers as they flew off when we startled them and the constant buzz of the cicadas created our rhythm as we investigated our surroundings
 All around us were wild animals: lizards with ringed tails in all different sizes and colors, lonely coyotes that trotted along way off in the distant horizon
 Doves, quail, jackrabbits, and roadrunners were as common as the cool breezes
 Scorpions, rattlesnakes, and other strange, poisonous creatures crept along the brown desert ground
 Although contact with those poisonous organisms was always a possibility, we tried to avoid them
 We navigated through the millions of mesquite bushes in bunches everywhere
 The bushes with their dark gray branches and deep, greenish-yellow tiny leaves clustered in small bunches added a beautiful contrast of color in our desert
 We loved to go out deep into the ever-expanding desert wilderness and forget all our problems, especially during the winter months
 When the winter days grew short and the weather was cold, we would cook out in the desert
 Yes, we would bring water, a cooking pot, salt, pepper, matches, and enough eggs so we could each have two
 Boiling up those eggs over a mesquite wood fire, arguing over who was going to get the cracked ones, and feeling hungry and anticipating our exceptional meal was wonderful
 Eventually, we actually ate the eggs while we sat in the brown desert sand
 We enjoyed them so, as they were always excellent
 There is nothing like eating desert-cooked boiled eggs in the winter desert of El Paso
 Winter turned to spring, and months later, I was watching TV one morning with no shoes on when my mom saw that there was a bump at the base of my toe that extended to my foot
 Mom said, "Look at that toe on your foot, your right foot!" "What are you talking about?" Mom's brows knit together as she bent forward for a closer look
 "What happened to your foot, Kevin?" "Mom, it's nothing!" I roared
 I think she was upset that she hadn't noticed it earlier
 I pointed to the toe
 "The bump here must have been caused at the same time as the toe break, back when I   kicked a rock playing in the flooded field
 This is some type of a delayed reaction
 It's nothing, Mom
 It doesn't even hurt
" My mother was not accepting any of my explanations
 "We're going to the doctor, and that foot is getting checked," she decided, and to the doctor we did go
 After the exam, Dr
 Goldner, whom I had known since I was ten, agreed with Mom
 In his unusually soft voice, he said, "Kevin's toe looks like something could be going on in there
 The X-ray revealed a cavity or hole in the bone
 I want Kevin to see a specialist, an orthopedic doctor, to find out what happened to the toe
" As he spoke, he looked at Mom
 We then immediately saw Dr
 Bassett, whose office was in the same building
 After one look at the toe and the X-rays, Dr
 Bassett, who was a big, heavyset guy, directed his attention to my mother
 "We need to perform surgery in order to go into the toe bone and scrape off samples of the bone tissue to test
" That will definitely hurt, I thought
 A wave of anxiety started developing, a rush of heat enveloped me, and I started to sweat
 What the hell is this doctor talking about? How do I prepare for this bone scraping? Why is it so necessary? What is going on? Surgery was set up immediately
 I remember getting wheeled into the operating room area while lying on my back
 I saw my name on a board up high on the wall with an L with a circle around it next to my name
 I called a nurse over and asked her if that L meant my left foot and proceeded to explain that the problem was in my right foot
 She seemed to ignore me, as they had already given me a shot of something to relax me and I probably didn't know what I was talking about
 I apparently kept going on about it, because Dr
 Bassett came into the room all dressed in green and looked at both my feet under the bright white sheet
 He then ordered that the notation above be corrected
 I think someone must have gotten in trouble for that little oversight
 After surgery, the doctor told my parents that he didn't like the look of what they found, although there was no cancer present in what they tested
 He wanted us to go see some experts on this type   of phenomenon to make sure that everything was okay and my strange-looking toe wasn't hiding anything sinister
 We were sent to Houston to see the specialists at the M
  D
 Anderson Tumor and Research Center
 I was sure that these experts would figure it all out and tell my parents that what had happened to my foot was really nothing serious, as I had known all along
    Mom and I wound our way through an absolutely enormous hospital with a labyrinth of hallways to a waiting room
 We were sitting in chairs so green they were almost black
 The smooth, pale walls had no interesting pictures hanging on them, and they seemed to go on forever in all directions
 The chairs were positioned perfectly in row after row after row, with people stuck in them
 I think these overused chairs could hold hundreds of people each day
 The sight of so many people waiting was very unsettling
 We were just like fish in a giant sea, waiting to witness what would happen next
 After waiting for what seemed like days, we were finally called to go into a waiting room just for us, a tiny room that had a pungent alcohol-type antiseptic smell
 I could not sit still
 I was rocking back and forth and tapping on the cylindrical metal container on the countertop
 I was feeling a bit tormented
 All this waiting was inhumane
 "Kevin, would you just be patient?" my mom almost whispered
 "The doctor will be seeing us very soon now
" What struck me was that Mom had just reprimanded me in a very calm voice
 Her speech did not exhibit a level of anger appropriate to my level of inappropriate behavior
 Mom was freaked out too
   Our waiting ended when several doctors bustled into the room and, after a brief exam, told us they immediately wanted to test the tissue on top of the bone where the bump was so they could determine what exactly it was
 One doctor even asked permission to take pictures of my foot, as this was something they had never seen before
 I thought this was cool; I was going to be in a medical book
 Well, my foot was, anyway! The shutter of the camera clicked away
 The sound of that camera doing its job was suddenly interrupted by Dr
 Bengerman
 He held my gaze as he assured me, "The biopsy won't hurt, Kevin, because I will inject some Novocain in the skin before I begin to cut through it
" The coolness of my photography session ended
 I could not believe that a simple injection of Novocain would prevent the pain that a sharp knife cutting through my skin to the bone was bound to inflict, and I became very tense
 After the photography session, I bravely went into a room that looked like an operating room and lay on my back as directed on a flat table in the room's center
 I remember thinking they should call the room the Antarctica chrome room, because everything except the ceiling and floor was coated with chrome
 Just entering the room gave me a cold feeling
 Lying on my back with my right leg all exposed, I felt as if I were in a refrigerator
 I actually started to shiver slightly, and my teeth began to chatter uncontrollably
 Dr
 Bengerman came into the room
 From my perspective on the table he seemed very tall and a little scary, masked and garbed for the procedure
 He reassured me again, saying quietly, "This won't hurt, Kevin
" I still didn't believe him
 He was an intern or student doctor who was instructed by the main surgeon assigned to me, Dr
 Green, to perform this procedure
 I focused on the chrome light fixture attached to the ceiling directly in my view, trying to blot out what was happening to me
   The pinch of the Novocain-filled needle hurt as it penetrated the skin
 It hurt a lot
 It hurt every time he pulled it out and pushed it back in, again and again
 However, Dr
 Bengerman was right; I didn't feel much of the actual cutting
 In fact, everything was fine until he started pressing down firmly with some type of scissors, snipping at an uplifted edge of the bump in an effort to remove a piece for testing
 I cringed when I heard a piece of the hard material ting against the metal light fixture that hung directly over the work area
 That clink made everything too real
 My foot was being cut into little pieces, and little pieces were being removed! I could not wait for the procedure to end
 I began fidgeting as electrical shock waves shot up my leg every time he firmly pressed down
 After what seemed to be an eternity, he finally sensed that what he was doing was killing me and abruptly stopped
 I was so thankful that he stopped
 He finished by putting in seven stitches, pulling the cut skin together in a crescent-moon-shaped line
 Dr
 Bengerman said, "Kevin, you did a great job
 Thank you!" He then left the refrigerated room
 It was over
 I was exhausted
 The nurse brought me back to my mom
 Mom took one look at my face and knew I had just gone through hell
 She looked sad and very concerned about me as she spoke to the doctor for a few minutes
 We left the hospital and went to my cousins' house where we were staying while we were in Houston
 Mom told me we would be coming back the next day to discuss the test results and the plans that would follow
 My foot began to hurt during the night and most of the next day, much to my naïve surprise
 However, I didn't want my mother to worry too much, so I acted as if the foot didn't hurt as much as it did
 You see, my mother is a professional worrier, and I have always felt uncomfortable seeing her distressed, angry, or sad
 The next day Dr
 Bengerman told Mom and me that he believed that the bump was a small growth
 He went on to say that it should be removed along with the toe and the connecting bone it surrounded in   my foot
 He told us that even though the growth was not cancerous, it should still be removed
 Arrangements for surgery were quickly made
 I slowly began to realize that I was to lose a toe
 Once more I was being wheeled to surgery, only this time I was going down a long narrow hallway
 One rectangular light was on the right and one on the left, catty-corner to each other
 This was mesmerizing as I sped along
 I watched one light fixture after the other after the other all the way to the stopping point at the end of this never-ending hallway
 As I took that surrealistic ride to the place where toes were removed (the "surgical suite"), I was beginning to feel the weird sensation caused by the injection they had just given me
 The last thing I remember are the doors slamming behind me as I slowly drifted into unconsciousness
 When I awoke, I saw my mom at my side
 I began to smile, but pain exploded in my foot and the smile turned to a grimace
 I felt as if I was being chased and the pain was catching up with me with a final boom
 I knew then that Dr
 Green must have definitely done what Dr
 Bengerman said should be done
 My foot was buried under inches of gauze wrappings, so I wasn't able to see exactly what he had done to me at this time
 But I could feel it
 It was a rough couple of days
 My hospital room could accommodate four patients, although there were only two guys already in there
 The cramped room was done all in tan: tan metal bed frames and headboards, tan walls, chairs, and cabinets
 A thin, dark tan curtain was draped halfway around my space, giving a slight sense of privacy
 I was happy to be next to the window even though I couldn't see anything out there from my point of view
 I could see only the natural beauty of the outside light filtering through the powder-blue sky showering over me as I lay helplessly in my bed
 This made me feel a little better
 The natural light gave me a warm feeling of health and well-being--or maybe it was just the pain medication
 I think my roommates were worse to deal with than the actual pain of the surgery
 One late night this old guy in the bed next to me who was always unconscious must have been given the wrong brownish milk-shake-type stuff in his feeding tube
   He started passing gas late that night
 The noise and stench from the tremendous gas attack he was having was so disgusting that it jarred me awake, despite all the medication I had received
 The room smelled so bad that I could not breathe
 I did not care how sick he was
 I just wanted him to stop emitting that suffocating odor
 I was desperate to make him stop and began thinking menacing thoughts, like moving his bed out in the hallway or out of the hospital altogether
 Well, since I couldn't physically do that, I wondered, what could I do? Finally I buzzed the nurse
 The intercom clicked and a somewhat gruff voice inquired, "Can I help you with something?" Choking, I tried to explain that I was suffocating
 I said, "Please rescue me from the exhaust fumes produced by my roommate, who was given some type of spoiled liquid nourishment for his last meal
" "Excuse me?" the inquiring voice said
 I was too nice of a kid or maybe just too shy to try to explain in more appropriate detail, so I let go of the intercom button and just breathed shallow breaths through my pillow for a while
 After all, I figured, he had to stop sometime--you know, eventually run out of gas
 Then there was a kid my age in the bed directly across from mine who had lost his leg above the knee from cancer
 He wore a knitted dark blue hat all the time because he had no hair
 I never really spoke to him, but I had to know why he didn't have any hair on his head
 Mom was my private investigator, and she found out everything--actually more than we wanted to know
 He was dying
 His chemotherapy had had no effect on the aggressive cancer, but it made him lose all his hair
 He made me feel very uneasy
 He was bald
 He was dying
 He was just a few feet away from me
 Looking at him made me wonder if I would lose my hair
 It's funny; I was never worried about or even thought about dying before I saw him
 My mom had spoken to the doctor, and when Dr
 Bengerman came to check on me, he told me, "Kevin, your hair isn't going anywhere, and it's something you needn't worry about
" I felt very embarrassed about this hair loss subject
 But my mom was there to   alleviate any of my fears and take care of me the best she could; you see, that's my mom, always taking care of her sons
 I spent three very long weeks in the hospital
 The doctors had pulled tendons over the void that they had made in my foot during the surgery
 They stretched my skin over the area, but the skin was not taking the abuse very well
 It looked black
 Later I found out that the doctors were considering doing a skin graft if the skin didn't heal quickly enough
 I'm glad I found out about that later; otherwise I would have had something else to worry about
 The skin had to heal before I could be sent back home
 It seemed as if I had to wait forever
 I remember one nice nurse named Emily who had a truly angelic, peaceful smile
 She was a beautiful lady, thin and petite
 I gave her some of my best handiwork
 I had a new set of grease pencils in every color of the rainbow
 I used every color at my disposal and my artistic ability to create scenes of the city and the countryside
 I drew animals and people in an effort to pass the time and keep busy
 She liked my artwork and encouraged me to draw
 I had taken art classes in my freshman, sophomore, and junior years and was planning to take one again my senior year
 My art teacher considered me one of her few advanced students and gave me art projects that were more challenging than those she gave the other students
 I found my natural talent and her instruction very helpful as I struggled to keep my mind off my problems
 One quiet evening, Nurse Emily said, "Kevin, why don't you travel around the hospital in the wheelchair to get some exercise and change your view?" "What? Emily, I'm embarrassed to have strangers see me like this
 People will stare at my strange, ugly-looking foot, with its blackened top, sutures, and missing toe, as it sticks out in front of me like some strange medieval battering ram
" Emily quickly discouraged this notion
 "You're in a hospital, Kevin, and that's the kind of thing people see in a hospital
 Don't be silly--just go," she said
 Hesitantly I rolled myself out of my room with some help from Emily as she waved me off with a quick upward motion of   her upheld arm
 The hallways seemed huge to me as I rolled myself along, with shiny, polished green floors and bright lights reflecting off the soft yellow walls
 The constant smell of antiseptics and alcohol permeated the air like a thick, floating, invisible mass
 No one stopped abruptly and stared
 They were all too busy with their own issues
 If people wanted to look at my foot, they did; if they didn't want to look, they didn't
 I started feeling a little more confident
 Traveling down an adjacent hallway after making two right turns, I discovered the room of a pro football player who had just lost his leg high above the knee because of cancer
 He was the hospital's local celebrity
 Many colorful flowers filled his room, on the floor and stacked on all the furniture, seemingly all the way to the ceiling
 Even though the lights in his room were dimmed, I noticed that he saw me out in the brightly lighted hallway
 I was too shy to talk or to dare interrupt his privacy, so I just wheeled myself away slowly, enjoying briefly the beautiful smell of all those flowers permeating the hallway
 I adjusted out of necessity or to just survive
 Three weeks in the hospital was a claustrophobic experience on many levels
 I was very happy to have Emily with me, mostly during the night shift, and of course, my mom was always with me during the day
 One night Emily, who became by far my favorite nurse, told me that she used to be a nun
 Her angelic aura, her pretty, powdery-white, soft smiling face with light blue eyes, and her short jet-black hair truly made her seem to me like a gift from God
 I don't know why she wasn't a nun anymore, but I was glad she was my nurse
 I appreciated her gentle kindness and genuine concern for my feelings of confusion and anger during this time in my life
 Sometimes during the afternoons I would sit with my mom in a small wooded area on the edge of the hospital's parking lot
 I ate Cheetos and fed them to the squirrels while we enjoyed the crisp breeze
 Mom and I talked about different things, but mostly I drove her crazy complaining about my confinement in this prison hospital over the few weeks that felt like an eternity
 She would do her best   to console me and give me advice on how to best cope with my predicament in a healthy way
 I had no patience for listening to helpful advice from my mother
 I wanted to go home! I was miserable
 I was being very selfish, though, because I was the one preventing her from being with my dad and brothers for such a long time
 Like a typical teenager, I dismissed her feelings because this was all happening to me
 Finally the day came when I was free to return home to my dad, brothers, and friends, whom, much to my surprise, I had missed very much
    I wasn't sure how the surgery would affect me when I returned to school
 I did have to become more guarded as I walked through the busy hallways to class
 If someone accidentally stepped on my foot or I banged it into something, I was in a temporary world of pain literally to the point of tears, although just as I reached that point, it quickly subsided
 The problems with my foot didn't stop me from wrestling, though
 I had been on the wrestling team since my freshman year
 I became an excellent wrestler, winning almost all my matches
 In the fall of , my senior year in high school, I was on the varsity wrestling team participating in the ninety-eight-pound weight class
 I was very proud of my athletic prowess, although I worried about how my damaged right foot would affect my performance
 I remember experiencing the greatest joy when Martha, a friend in my physics class, asked me to speak to her brother
 He was a freshman that year, and she wanted me to speak to him about joining the wrestling team
 She knew I was into the sport since I spoke about it often, and had also seen me in action, winning my matches during various school tournaments
 I guess she was impressed with my wrestling performances, since she actually asked me to talk to   her brother about it
 When I first joined the wrestling team my freshman year, I weighed only seventy-five pounds
 During my senior year I was only five feet six and weighed barely ninety-eight pounds
 Anyway, Martha thought that being on the wrestling team would help her brother develop character since he was built on the small side, as I was
 I waited to meet him one day in the school courtyard
 Standing by the drinking fountain, I waited as this blond-headed kid came sauntering over, walking as if he owned the world
 "Hey, man," I broadcasted with a big smile on my face, "wrestling will make you tougher than any other sport you can think of or decide to even try
 It will give you an opportunity to go up against someone your size and weight class, unlike any other sport
 Wrestling will give you an even chance of excelling in a sport
 Man, you should most definitely check it out
" Martha's brother tapped his foot, his eyes looking all around the schoolyard as I continued to compare the virtues of wrestling to football and basketball
 Finally his patience ended
 "Listen," he said, "the kid in my weight class is tough as hell
 No one in the school can beat him
 I'll never get the varsity spot, so why should I even try?" Suppressing a smile, I announced, "You should still try out and spend your first year learning the sport and preparing to be the best in your weight class for the following year or even the year after that
" "No, thanks," he scoffed, threw his hand up at me with a jerk, and took off
 As he rounded the corner, I let the laughter escape my lips as my chest swelled with pride
 I was the kid in his weight class no one in the whole school could beat
 I loved wrestling so much! It gave me, slightly built kid that I was, the edge I needed to excel in a sport and get some greatly appreciated respect from my schoolmates
 I have always demanded respect from others, and although I was small in size, I was very large in spirit
 From time to time my attitude most definitely got me in trouble with kids who were bigger than me
 Some big kids turned out to be big jerks
 My grandfather Alan would always have something to say to me when I told him about an incident in school relating to my   size
 When he would see me seriously depressed about this size issue, he would just say in his studious, melodious voice, "Remember, Kevin, a dime is smaller than a penny, but it's ten times more valuable
 Don't you ever forget that
" Wrestling season always started at the tail end of football season
 Usually I eagerly anticipated the start of the season, but this year I was nervous
 We would all line up, strip down, and get weighed so the coaches could verify the weight class to which each of us belonged before every competition
 My stomach turned over and I thought I would throw up as I took my socks and shoes off and prepared to join the other boys by the scale for the first time after my surgery
 Undressed, I marched over to the scale
 As I stood on the cold weight scale, my scarred right foot, with its very obvious missing toe, was all exposed for everyone to see
 I was sure everyone was staring at my right foot as I slowly positioned myself on the scale, balancing
 I was relieved when no one mentioned a word about my foot, which made me wonder if anyone actually even noticed it
 I wrestled well that season, winning most of my matches, and was rewarded with a letter jacket after the season ended
 I treasured that jacket and still have it hanging in a special place in my closet today
 My teammates and I did so well that we were all invited to attend a state regional wrestling tournament
 The regional tournament in Carlsbad, New Mexico, was, to my great surprise, one of the most interesting and challenging events in my wrestling career
 I walked into what was for me the largest single room I had ever been in for a wrestling tournament
 My heart was pounding as I saw that there were at least eight wrestling mats covering the floor
 Some mats were purple with light blue delineating the out-of-bounds area and the center point of the match area
 Other mats were dark brown with white trim, orange highlighted with blue, and yellow edged with green
 Our school had a match scheduled against a high school for the blind, so that meant that each person on our team had to wrestle a blind kid in our respective weight class
 When it was possible, I started watching the kids from the school for the blind warming   up
 As I watched, I noticed them apparently unconcerned about what people thought about their disability
 I felt ashamed as this overwhelming feeling of embarrassment quickly overcame me
 I was so concerned about what people thought about me, seeing my foot with an amputated toe
 How could I be so damn self-conscious about it when all those blind kids were ready to wrestle and win for themselves and their school? I quickly found myself feeling a profound level of respect and admiration for those tough blind kids
 I saw them as being very brave souls, braver than I was
 Our coach cautioned us not to feel sorry for our opponents because they were blind
 In his loud southern voice, he said, "Remember, your opponent won't feel sorry for you!" I couldn't feel sorry for my opponent, because he was winning every match
 He won the regional tournament in our weight class
 However, it turned out that I was the only one he couldn't pin
 That gave me a bit of pride in myself and earned me continued respect from my teammates, although my coach was still obviously very pissed off at me all afternoon
 You see, the coach always put more pressure on me because the lowest-weight class always went first in a team wrestling match
 Winning that first match was fantastic for team spirit
 If you lost, well, I won't say how I or the team felt about that--you can imagine
 It was an honor to be in the ninety-eight-pound weight class, and I always truly believed that and worked very hard to be the best wrestler I could
 That match with the blind kid was more important than many I had won
 It taught me that I would be okay, despite the loss of my toe
 Whatever I had to face was better, or not as intense, as being blind was
 If he could make something of himself even though he was blind, I would do fine even with only nine toes
 School and wrestling had to be interrupted by periodic checkups
 After a super-long wait as usual, Mom and I were called into our private little waiting area
 Sitting and smelling that antiseptic alcohol smell was becoming all too familiar, and I didn't like it
 I can almost taste it, I thought to myself
   Suddenly Dr
 Bengerman came into our tiny room, moving quickly in his bright white lab coat
 I felt a slight calm inside, seeing his familiar face
 That changed quickly when he began to speak
 "Hello, Mrs
 Garrison
 Hi, Kevin
 I have the reports as to the makeup of the tumor
 We carefully analyzed it to see exactly what it was composed of
 We found cancer present
" I stared into his emotionless face
 Did he just say I had cancer? I felt my head slowly become numb as all the blood left from it
 I couldn't think
 I had begun to hate these hospital visits
 We always had to wait and wait for these terrible appointments
 I just sat back and listened as the doctor explained his thoughts to us, the shocked occupants of this tiny exam room
 As we understood it, all the doctors involved thought the tumor had begun growing in the bottom of my foot and then formed a tube that took a path to my toe bone and began attacking it
 They believed that the increased blood flow to the broken toe attracted the tumor and encouraged it to grow
 The tumor dissolved the bone tissue, creating the mysterious cavity in the bone as it continued to grow up and around to the surface of my foot
 It surrounded the other foot bones like the Blob from the old Steve McQueen movie
 It had spread under the skin until it pushed the skin up, creating the unexplained bump
 I found the whole story very hard to believe
 It didn't make any sense to me
 I thought that it was only an educated guess, at best, and that they really couldn't know for sure
 Then we found out that Mom and I would need to make a trip to Houston every three months
 This was the only way the doctors could make sure that no tumors were growing and that every last cancerous cell was excised from my body
 For the next ten years, I would have to undergo periodic examinations before I could be declared cancer-free and know for sure that other than missing a toe, my right foot was just fine
    These newly mandated follow-up visits were rapidly becoming quite routine for me
 Mom and I would travel to Houston and then go directly to the hospital, where we would wait in a huge room with dozens of other patients
 We learned eventually that the surgeons operated in the morning and reserved the afternoon for consultations and follow-up visits
 The doctors would have all their patients come in at : p
m
 and sit around and wait until they were called
 After they finished all their surgeries, they would see us anxious waiting patients
 In my case, it was not anxiety I was feeling; I would call it complete agitation
 One late May afternoon, Mom and I were back in Houston for another follow-up visit
 We sat in the brightly lit waiting room, which was, as always, filled to capacity with patients and family members
 I thought the dark green marble floor tiles made this giant room seem quite classy for a hospital clinic
 The interminable wait made me jumpy and unsettled as usual
 I didn't want to be part of this sea of humanity, waiting for the all-clear to keep the rest of my body intact
 My impatience made it impossible for me to concentrate on schoolwork or other diversions that needed my attention
 Reading   got old fast
 The contents of the magazines bored me
 The light reflecting off the glossy pages annoyed me
 Reading had never been one of my favorite activities, and trying to absorb what was on the pages under those circumstances nauseated me
 Instead, I found different ways to entertain myself
 One of my favorite diversions was to bother my mother
 I would think of things to do and say that I was sure would evoke a reaction
 My favorite one was to say, "Let's go!" I'd then quickly get up from my chair and start walking
 I would immediately come back and sit down, saying, with all this drama in my voice, "I just can't take this sitting around anymore, Mom!" Mom would just smile and continue to read her magazine
 She never even glanced up when I did that along with making other continuous, useless comments
 Even though my antics elicited very little reaction from Mom, I found it extremely entertaining
 I guess it was because I didn't have to share her with my brothers--she was mine alone to bother
 I liked the attention very much
 I guess dealing with me was more frustrating than trying to read her magazine, and as I watched my mom continue to ignore me, I thought her magazine was surely more interesting than my inane questions and comments
 People-watching also provided entertainment
 I would look around the room and wonder why all these people were there
 I was probably better off not knowing their stories since from time to time we heard about some very sad situations
 Sometimes looking around at the mangled people sitting in row after row of perfectly aligned silver-framed vinyl chairs was just too much
 During one visit, there was a beautiful young lady sitting across the aisle from me
 She had long, straight, shiny brown hair, big brown eyes, and a slender face with an ivory complexion
 She sat with her back perfectly straight and her head held high with pride
 Her posture had an almost regal bearing to it
 I was impressed
 I continued to eagerly study her when I noticed that she was wearing a poncho that completely covered her upper body
 Slowly I realized that she must have selected that garment because she wanted to conceal the fact that she had only one arm
   The girl was in good shape compared with the man occupying the chair at the end of my row
 His lower jaw had been completely removed
 A white gauze pad that was drenched with his spittle was hanging out of his mouth
 It had been placed there in an attempt to prevent his saliva from dripping out of what remained of his mouth and soaking him
 I knew I shouldn't, but I couldn't help staring at him
 Eventually he looked back at me, and I looked away, sliding way back in my seat
 I could not comprehend that he was a man looking back at me, a fellow human being, not some alien from another universe
 When I allowed myself to finally accept that this was a guy who just had his lower jaw removed, feelings of sadness overwhelmed me so quickly and so deeply that I had to distract myself and think of something else quickly or I would probably start crying
 During this visit we had to wait until 
 before the doctor could see us
 I lost track of how many times I had told my mother I was ready to leave
 When it was finally our turn, we met Dr
 Edmend
 Dr
 Edmend was new to my case
 He was overweight, short, and balding
 His beady eyes needed thick glasses to help them see my thick chart and X-rays
 He droned on about the state of my condition, saying that the chest X-ray and blood workup was fine
 He spoke mainly to my mom
 My thoughts drifted off as I wondered if I could ask to borrow his glasses
 They were so thick that I was sure I could quickly start a fire using the lenses and the sun next time I went camping with my friends
 Yep, those glasses, hot sun, and a dry, dark gray piece of old mesquite wood would start a great fire
 I was thinking about this when a disturbing comment pricked through my daydream
 Dr
 Edmend noted, "If they had realized any cancer was present prior to the surgery that removed the toe, they would have removed half of the foot at the same time instead of just the toe
 That's the only way to be sure that no growth will reoccur again in the future
" That's great, I thought
 I could have lost half my foot instead of just one toe
 I was very happy that things had worked out as they had
 It   was tough enough dealing with a missing toe
 I didn't want to think how it would be to walk around with only half a foot
 Mom paled after hearing the doctor's remarks
 Her reaction was a bit confusing to me
 Mom always worries about everything so much, I thought
 I was shaken up, but I just wanted to get out of the hospital and get back to El Paso
 I will be fine, I thought
 This crap is over
 Let's go!    I had a follow-up visit scheduled for April, about a year after the surgery that took my toe
 I thought my foot looked fine
 I would study its appearance from time to time, examining it from every possible angle
 Although I noticed that some swelling had developed on the top of my foot over the old surgery area, I rationalized that it was just scar tissue that had formed over the past year
 As far as I was concerned, my foot looked fine, I felt fine, and these follow-up visits were a waste of time and money
 Going to Houston for my regular checkups was about as eventful as yearly visits to the dentist
 No cavities and no problems with my foot! By now I had so much experience going to these regular appointments that my parents decided I could go alone
 I looked forward to traveling by myself and feeling independent
 Things were tight financially for my parents, and not having to spend money on Mom's airfare would definitely be beneficial
 My cousins Judy and Max, who lived in a nice suburb in the Houston area with their four young boys, Josh, Allen, Bill, and Joey, were available to pick me up at the airport and take me to the hospital for my appointment
 Everything had become so routine   that even my overly protective mother felt at ease with the notion of me making this visit without her
 The plane ride was uneventful
 I had fantasized that my seatmate would be an absolutely gorgeous babe who would find me undeniably attractive and that we would be madly in love by the time the plane landed in Houston
 Instead of finding an alluring blonde looking up at me with adoring blue eyes, the person occupying the seat next to mine was an obese elderly lady whose sour expression seemed to declare that she was pissed off at the world
 Her bulk rolled into my seat as her plump arm hovered over the shared armrest
 I looked out the window the entire flight, enjoying the view of the clouds and fields below, daydreaming and enjoying my independence, even though I was a little lonely
 When the plane landed, I sauntered off in what I hoped was a cool, independent manner and was met by my cousins and their entire family
 The next day I confidently went for what I was sure would be a routine exam
This exam room was very small--almost claustrophobic
 A bright white light illuminated the room, which had blue cabinets on all the walls and an exam table in the middle
 The harsh mixture of antiseptics and other medicines irritated my nose as usual
 Suddenly the door opened and a very tall, thin doctor came in
 I had never met this doctor
 My hair stood on end, but I had no idea how his words were going to change my life
 "Hello, Kevin, I'm Dr
 Doomalson," this very young, somewhat nervous resident stammered
 "I have been asked to perform your evaluation for today's visit
" I watched him turn away and begin to slowly scan my chart
 I found his voice to be a bit louder than normal
 When he finished after a few minutes, he looked up at me and asked, "Kevin, can I examine your right foot?" I just nodded
 Dr
 Doomalson held my cold foot in his warm hand and began to lightly push and squeeze the area that had been operated on, near the toes but on the top of the foot, close to my big toe
 He abruptly let go of my foot and began to stand up
 "I will be back in a few minutes, Kevin," he blurted out in his strangely loud voice
 When he reentered the room, Dr
 Doomalson was accompanied by five other doctors, all clad in white lab coats   just like his, and all of them wearing serious expressions
 I felt my blood pressure rising
 It was absolutely surreal having all these doctors circled around me, or rather my foot
 This visit was no longer routine
 One of the doctors pressed firmly on the top of the surgery area, and another squished the sides
 Another just had a solemn expression but said nothing
 The last two doctors just continued with their very serious expressions, but looked strangely eager just to see my foot
 All of them were deep in thought, apparently fascinated by its overall appearance
 They did not include me as they discussed my foot in cryptic medical jargon
 After about four or five long minutes they all left
 The door closed and I was alone to contemplate their strange behavior
 After a while, Dr
 Doomalson returned and took the same seat he had when he first began my exam
 He did not look calm and nonchalant
 He looked concerned and upset
 His loud voice quivered as he asked, "How old are you?" Why would he be nervous about asking me how old I was? "I'm seventeen," I answered
 His eyes dropped to the floor as though it pained him to look directly at me
 He slowly lifted his head as though it had doubled in weight, and looked me right in the eyes
 He spoke out, asking, "Is there anyone with you, Kevin?" I told him quickly, "My cousins are picking me up after the appointment, but there is no one with me at the hospital
" He hesitated before he blurted out the shocking news
 "We feel you have a ninety-five percent chance of having your right foot amputated due to the reoccurrence of the tumor
" I was quiet for some very long seconds
 The effect of those words as I tipped my head back, looking directly at the blinding bright lights above, shocked me in a way that I had never experienced before
 Tears quickly began to well in the corners of my eyes
 The pit of my stomach tightened with a strange, sick feeling, and I almost shook with emotion
 I just wanted to leave that tiny claustrophobic exam room and the doctor
 Surely if I just left, everything would go back to normal
   Those horrible words with their gruesome image would go away if only I could get out of the hospital
 I am not dealing with this
 I am not going to come back to this hospital, I thought as I started feeling a tiny bit more in control
 I'm only seventeen
 How can this be happening to me? I wished very much that my mother was with me as I sat there feeling so alone
 Dr
 Doomalson looked at me with concern, trying to decide how I was accepting his news
 "Don't think of not coming back here," he warned
 I hadn't realized that mind reading was one of his talents
 "The tumor will continue to grow until it begins to stretch your skin, and eventually it will try to break through your skin
 It must be removed from your body
" I didn't respond
 I didn't blink or say a word
 Again, he said, "The tumor must be removed, Kevin
" "You said ninety-five percent
 What does that mean exactly?" I asked after I was finally able to organize my thoughts
 "We will test the tumor for cancer
 There is a possibility that we could leave you with part of your foot if there is no cancer present, but we really don't recommend it
 Going through life at your age with part of a foot can lead to arthritis in the remaining ankle joint, giving you a painful ankle that's of little use to you
 I conferred with my colleagues, and we all feel it is cancerous and the best thing for you to do at this time would be to have the foot removed just above the ankle so that you are rid of the tumor," he explained
 He looked at me to see if I understood what he was telling me
 "We would then test the remaining tissue and bone at the bottom of your leg to make sure all the cancer is gone before we finish the surgery and stitch you up
 We feel the tumor is growing slowly enough for you to go back home, finish high school, and return for the surgery in three months
 You should have a very successful outcome, Kevin," he added
 I told him that my brother was having his bar mitzvah in June and asked if it would be okay if I had the surgery after that
 Dr
 Doomalson said, "The tumor is growing at a very slow rate
 The three-month wait will be fine
 Tomorrow we will need to do some lab workups to check on a few more things before you return home
"   He left the room and I followed along behind him like a puppy
 He showed me where I would need to go for the lab work and said good-bye
 I felt so alone
 I was the saddest I had ever been in my entire life
 I found a phone and called my cousin Max to tell him that my appointment was finished and I was ready to be picked up
 I could not get the words out fast enough
 I started crying, telling him that I had a  percent chance of losing my entire foot
 I hadn't meant to tell him that news over the phone, but I needed to tell someone, and the words just poured out
 Max arrived so quickly, he must have flown to get to the hospital
 It seemed as if I had just hung up the phone and there he was
 I was happy as hell to see him
 We went back to his house, and as soon as we arrived, I asked to call my mother and father
 It was a terrible call to my mother
 The emotions of the call cloud my recollection of the details
 My mother answered the phone with her normal worrisome, concerned motherly personality
 I knew this news would distress her, but I needed to share this tragic news with her and my father
 First, I told her everything the doctor had told me
 She wept quietly and gave the phone to my dad, who tried very hard to accept what I was telling him without revealing any emotion over the phone
 He could not hide what he was feeling, and his voice choked until he couldn't speak anymore
 He handed the phone back to my mom
 She had used those few minutes to compose herself, but her voice still shook
 "I want to know everything, so tell it to me again," she directed
 In a dull monotone, I repeated the doctor's news with its tragic and unbelievable consequences
 She asked when I would be coming home, and I told her that I had to take some tests the next day before I could leave
 She asked to speak to my cousin Max
 He assured her he would not leave my side until I was on the plane home
 Mom asked me to pray and ask for God's help with this situation
 I said I would, and I hung up the phone and moved away from it
 I felt like a zombie with no place to go
 I desperately wanted to find peace
 Max was sensitive to my situation
 He asked if I wanted to talk, and stayed quiet when I didn't
 Max was very good to me
 His   behavior and kindness surprised me since he was usually so serious and distracted all the time
 He insisted on staying with me all day in the hospital when I went the next day
 I don't know if he did it because my mom asked him to or his wife, Judy, told him to, but I needed and appreciated his company
 He was a busy real estate agent, so I knew it was a sacrifice for him to take a whole day to be with me
 I have never forgotten that act of kindness and have always remembered him and his whole family for their benevolent help throughout my ordeal
 Bright and early the following morning Max and I went directly to the location Dr
 Doomalson had pointed out
 The doctor's order was to first draw a lot of blood
 They had ordered the phlebotomist to take a huge syringe full, so much that I almost fainted
 They gave me some tasteless orange juice and made me rest for a few minutes before I went for a chest X-ray, the next doctor's request
 The doctors wanted me to stay in Houston for one more day while they studied the results and decided if more tests would be necessary
 I was ecstatic when I received permission to go home
 The surgery was set for June , 
 I didn't want to think about what would happen on that day, my next scheduled return visit
 Looking at the clouds as the plane carried me home, I thought about my newly discovered destiny to become a foot amputee
 I wasn't sure how I would deal with it
 I debated what type of front I wanted to present to my friends and family
 Surely, I could milk this horrid situation for all it was worth
 I could receive tons of sympathy and have everyone wait on me hand and foot, or I could be the tough guy and act like nothing bothered me
 After much contemplation, I decided to be the tough guy and deny myself the luxury of expressing my true, legitimate feelings
 I wasn't going to show my overwhelming anger at finding myself in this horrendous situation
 I wasn't sure how to adjust to this, because I didn't have the ability to adjust, so I would be the macho, tough guy
 I found myself trapped in a state of nonaccepting limbo
 As we got ready to land in El Paso, I noticed what a strange sight it was
 The desert looked as if some giant alien vacuum device had sucked up everything green with some color-sucking contraption
   All you could see from the plane were a million shades of brown, from the lightest barely tan to the darkest almost black
 There was a strange beauty to it, I thought
 The expanse of it was pierced through the middle by the Franklin Mountain Range with its winding jagged peaks and valleys, and the beautiful sunset in the distance
 I looked to the west
 The desert seemed to stretch on forever over the mesas of the lower valley, where it finally reached out to the beautiful, colorful, sun-setting sky
 The magnificent multicolored sky consisted of light blues, pinks, oranges, and brilliant shades of purple
 The plane finally landed, and I emerged into the welcoming embrace of my family
    No one in the family seemed to know what to do or say
 My mom and dad and my brothers were very quiet and let me do whatever I wanted with little interference
 There was a cloud of sadness surrounding our family
 It was almost as if someone had died, and I could not ignore the fact that I was the one responsible for generating that atmosphere
 My older brother, Ed, who was two years my senior, had no idea how he could help me deal with the inner turmoil I was feeling
 I could easily see concern in his sad, dark brown eyes, although he didn't seem to realize how much I needed his help
 He never spoke to me about it
 I didn't resent that because I hadn't realized myself that I could have used his help
 Eric, my younger brother, was just twelve at the time and didn't have a clue about what I was thinking or feeling
 My friends were a great distraction
 When I went out with my friends, I could forget about the pending surgery
 Everyone had something to do and someplace to go, and there was just plain fun to be had
 I found myself going out with my friends at every opportunity
 I wanted to thoroughly enjoy these last carefree, whole-body days and not focus solely on my upcoming operation
 I did not want to think about what was going to happen to me when   school ended, and that would be possible only if no one at high school was aware of my impending ordeal
 Unfortunately, that was not meant to be
 My mom obviously had a different approach to dealing with the stress she had endured from my medical situation
 She wanted to talk
 One of the people she chose to share with was my friend Andy's mom
 My mom told Andy's mom all the details of the amputation of my foot scheduled for June
 Andy's mom told her family all about it, and Andy made sure that the news spread
 Needless to say, the whole student body began wondering why I was back
 Why was I not having surgery, and what exactly was going on with my foot? I absolutely hated the questions! Walking down the hall, people would stop and stare
 Some kids would literally be looking at my feet while we talked
 I felt very uncomfortable, like my foot had a big arrow on it, drawing everyone's attention
 I quickly became very angry that I was such a great topic of discussion
 I really thought that I could keep the whole thing a secret and that no one would ever know; you see, that was my plan
 I would tell whomever I wanted to in my own good time, when I felt ready to share my personal situation with a select few of my closest friends
 The real truth is, I felt I would be rejected
 I would not be viewed ever again as a normal kid, and I absolutely could not handle that thought at all
 I was glad that most of my friends would be scattering when school was finished
 They were going all over the country to different colleges, and some of them were even going to travel for a few months before starting college
 This would all work in my favor, I thought
 No one would be around, everyone would be off doing his or her own thing, and no one would focus on me
 I was pissed off at Andy for spreading the rumor about my situation
 Well, I guess it was not a rumor, since I was going to have surgery in June, but it was my story and I hadn't wanted it circulating throughout the school
 Naturally, Andy denied telling anyone when I confronted him
 I didn't believe him
 I vowed to get even with him someday soon
 I felt like really smacking him around
 I found myself yelling at him, our faces less than an inch apart, my   face filled with rage, his with fear
 I thought his eyes would pop out of his head
 I felt deeply violated by my so-called friend Andy
 I had known him almost since the first day we moved to El Paso when I was just ten years old, and we had spent a lot of time together
 In high school, we weren't as friendly as we had been when we were younger
 I knew he was a storyteller because he told stories all the time, but I never knew he could be so insensitive
 I guess he just couldn't resist a good, hot story no matter whose feelings got hurt in the process
 We weren't close friends anymore, but I didn't think he would deliberately make me an object of his gossip
 As much as I could, I downplayed all the comments, ignored the questions, and disregarded the strange and pitying looks that I received
 Relatively soon the buzz at school had calmed down, and I was very grateful for that
 It was enough to deal with the fact that in three months, on June , , I would be having my right foot amputated
 I did not need a constant reminder of it from anyone
 I would deal with it in my own way! I was very stoic, and my father observed, "You seem to be handling this situation very well, son
 It doesn't seem to bother you at all
" "There is nothing I can do about it, so why worry or go around being upset about it?" I grumbled
 However, I thought about it every damn day, although I would never actually allow myself to dwell on the details of what was going on and what would be happening all too soon
 If I had let myself think about what I would undergo in June, I would probably have cried every day and become a catatonic mess
 I was also concealing an immense amount of anger and resentment
 I kept thinking, Why me? What did I do to deserve this? What have I done in the past that was so terrible that I deserved this punishment? Sometimes I would actually have the luxury of forgetting about it completely for short periods of time as I went about living my life as best as I could
 I would look at my right foot some nights before going to sleep and find myself talking to it as if it weren't part of my body
 "You're going to be gone soon," I'd say to it
 It looked fine; it felt fine
 Why did it have to go? Some nights I would stare at the   foot, almost willing it to answer
 I hated this nonstop nightmare in which I found myself
 Most nights I would lie in bed, praying for help
 Often I just could not sleep at all but would toss and turn, sometimes burying my face in the pillow, wanting to scream, and other times staring up into the blackness, asking for help, hoping I would come out of this nightmare intact
 I still have the last picture of myself with my right foot
 I was wearing a bathing suit and standing in our driveway next to the black  Volkswagen Beetle that my older brother and I shared
 We were so proud of that car
 Most of our friends didn't have one
 This was our car to share; my dad had given it to us because we would both be needing it for college soon, and with Mom and Dad working all the time, we really needed it to get around town
 My brother Ed and I took turns driving it on the weekends
 The car had been a great diversion and helped keep my mind off the impending surgery
 I was just starting to go on dates and have fun with my friends, and having a car made it easier and much more fun
 I had been sharing a mini-six-pack of beer with a friend, Johnny, and our girlfriends, Maloney and Saundra
 We were all under twenty-one and disregarding the legal drinking age in the state of Texas
 But we were partying and having fun, and didn't really care
 As we consumed those beers, we loosened up considerably on a beautiful starlit night parked on the Rio Grande levee
 On the way back to the party, my girlfriend, Saundra, put her head in my lap as she lay on her back across the front seat while I drove
 She put her arms around my neck
 "Kiss me," she implored with her lips in a drunken sexy pout
 She was definitely feeling the effects of the beer
 I had a little sense left in me and shook my head
 "Please," she said, pulling my head down and looking all too tempting
 I decided I was talented enough to continue driving and kiss her at the same time
 I rationalized that if I drove slowly enough, I could hold the steering wheel straight and the car would just go perfectly straight down the road through the neighborhood
 No problem, I thought; this way we could get back to the party without too much delay and still kiss a little
   As our make-out session intensified, the car angled slightly off the road
 Suddenly we found ourselves shooting through and up a small irrigation canal that acted like a ramp, rocketing us up into the air and clipping off the top of a low stone wall
 I saw a tree bounce off the hood of the car with an eardrum-shattering crash
 It hit the top of the car, bouncing a couple of times before it rolled over my beautiful black  Beetle and fell to the side as the car finally stopped with a crunch
 Physically we were okay
 The skin around Saundra's pierced ear was a little torn
 No one else suffered even minor wounds
 Mentally is another story
 I was stressed to the max already, and with my dad having to come and get me, I felt terrible
 The homeowners whose property I had just damaged called the police, and while dealing with them I thought I would have a heart attack any minute and pass out
 My heart was pounding
 Suddenly the nighttime blackness of the upper valley in the desert city of El Paso looked much darker and felt much colder, and I was truly about to pass out
 Riding home with my dad, all I could think about was how horribly my life was going
 I wondered how I would survive everything
 When Dad and I arrived home, he said only four words to me: "You're paying for everything
" My dad had always been strict
 I did not think of asking him to help me pay for it or to take pity on me because of what I was going through
 When he spoke only four words and said nothing else, I knew I had gotten off easy
 Dad could easily have said, "Son, you'll be staying home on the weekends for three weeks," as he had said repeatedly throughout my life for much smaller offenses
 All I had to do was pay for the damages
 I think my dad didn't punish me strongly because he knew I was going through a difficult time in my life
 I thought Ed would kill me when I told him about it, but he quickly calmed down, to my great surprise
 He even thought the story about how the accident had occurred was kind of funny
 I wasn't laughing! Ed went easy on me too
 When Ed was really pissed off, he would usually give me at least a painful slug to the shoulder
 Sometimes he would even push   me down and with a knee on my chest give me major verbal abuse until he thought I had gotten what I deserved, and he cooled off
 My friend Johnny and his girlfriend were very upset about it all and stayed that way for weeks
 The accident took place about a month before my surgery, and I barely spoke to my friend again until well afterward
 My girlfriend had to deal with the fact that I blamed her for the whole thing
 I wound up never speaking to her again after the accident
 It was also my last date for a long time, not because of anybody else, just me
 One day in physics class, a girl named Rosemary casually walked over and sat in the seat next to me temporarily before class started
 She whispered as she leaned toward me with a slight smile, "Kevin, you wrecked your car into my fence
" She then immediately got up and walked slowly to her usual seat without looking back
 Wow, I thought
 The house my car landed in belongs to Rosemary
 I was surprised but happy to learn this
 Of course, I pleaded with her as soon as I possibly could to please have her father go easy on me as he figured out all the damages to their property and prepared a bill for me to pay
 I begged her all through the class period whenever an opportunity presented itself
 She was actually very nice, surprisingly so, and assured me that she would do her best to persuade her father to give me a break
 I think she liked me
 He ended up not giving me a break, just sending me copies of all the repair costs and expecting me to reimburse him in full
 Somehow I managed to pay him back
 As I washed pots and pans in a local cafeteria, I regretted that my wages went to Rosemary's father rather than into my own pocket
 My savings covered the $
 worth of damage to our beautiful black  Volkswagen Beetle
 Sweating profusely over smelly, very hot soapy water, I vowed that never again would I get so drunk that I let alcohol make me that stupid
 Finally, graduation day arrived, and along with the rest of the class of , I left Coronado High School behind me
 I was thrilled that four long, boring years of high school were finally completed
 I experienced a nice sense of finality and a feeling of accomplishment though
 Graduating was something I had looked forward to from the first day I set foot in the high school building
   However, I had no idea that I would have such mixed feelings about graduation once the day finally arrived
 Graduation meant that the upcoming surgery was just around the corner, and I had been making great efforts not to think about it at all
 The distraction of school was now over
 When Grandma Ida and Grandpa Joe came to town shortly after I graduated from high school, I started feeling even more uneasy
 They didn't make me feel uncomfortable, but their arrival was another signal that the clock was ticking down until it would be time for surgery
 They insisted on driving Mom and me from El Paso to the hospital in Houston and staying for a few days after the surgery
 Jacob, my grandfather's brother, and his wife, Penina, came from Israel for my brother Eric's bar mitzvah and stayed for my surgery
 Dad couldn't come with us to Houston since he had to stay home and work and also manage my two brothers--well, mainly my younger brother, the bar mitzvah boy
 Soon we left for Houston in my grandfather's gorgeous, huge, metallic greenish-silver Buick Electra  Wildcat, with a light green plush interior and excellent air-conditioning
 My grandmother took the greatest pride in telling everyone, in her heavy Russian accent, that she would have to put her sweater on in the car at times because the A/C was so powerful and the car would get too cold
 I got to sit up front next to the driver, my grandfather, and my grandmother, the aggravating co-pilot
 They loved me so much that I could always really feel it when I was with them, and I liked that very much
 We drove for a long time before we finally stopped for an overnight stay at some hotel that I'm sure was highly recommended by the AAA organization, to which my grandfather subscribed
 He had designed our road map with AAA's help, and we followed it meticulously
 Grandpa affectionately called the road map a "trip ticket
" About an hour after checking in, I decided I needed to get some exercise
 I was feeling tremendous anxiety
 While everyone else was resting, I started walking around on these low redbrick walls out in the parking lot for a while, testing my great balancing skills and just enjoying stretching my legs
   Mom saw me, strolled over, and asked, "What are you doing, Kev?" I thought for a second before I snapped at her, saying, "I might as well enjoy my balancing skills now because I will never be able to do this again
" Her look of curiosity was replaced immediately with a look of sadness
 Of course, what I said freaked Mom out
 She had nothing else to say and promptly walked away, leaving me alone with my heated, angry attitude
 My poor mom--I don't know how she put up with me throughout this terrible time in my life
 I really did not sleep much at all that night because I was so jumpy inside
 Scary questions kept popping into my mind: If they remove my foot, will it stop with that? Will they just remove more leg if they see they need to? Will this continue until I have nothing left? It was a long drive east to Houston, but we finally got there the next day
 It was amazing to be driving for a whole day and still be in the same state
 Texas is truly a great big beautiful state
 I think the most annoying thing about the drive was dealing with the alarm buzzer that my grandfather had set so he would not drive over the speed limit
 On the futuristic-looking linear speedometer in the dash was this needle with a little bright red ball that could be moved to the speed number you wanted to drive under by simply turning a little dial
 If you passed it because you were driving too fast, you were forced to hear an annoying electric buzzing sound until you slowed to less than that specific speed
 Well, the buzzer buzzed all across the huge state of Texas, making it seem even bigger, if that's possible
 I had buzzing in my ears well after we arrived in Houston and were finally freed from the confines of the car
 I was feeling even more nervous now, probably because of that damn awful buzzing noise
   Kevin with his brothers and the  Volkswagen Beetle    The time before the surgery was just a blur
 It was so intense, I was numbed into a protective mental cocoon that sheltered me so that I could survive what was to come
 I just could not think about it anymore
 If I did, I would die of fright
 It was in that state of mind that I was wheeled into surgery again
 When I woke up this time, things were more serious
 Eventually, I peeked under the thin white sheet to see what they had done to me
 I could see that there was obviously no foot there any longer
 All I could see was a white gauze bandage wrapped in the form of a small volleyball around my right ankle area
 I did not realize until approximately ten years later how deep a state of denial I had put myself in
 I could not allow myself to accept the fact that my foot was now amputated
 I didn't even cry
 Apparently in order for me to emotionally survive the loss of my foot, I subconsciously felt I had to deny my true feelings
 I had legitimate feelings of intense anger and fear about my unknown life to come as an amputee
 I carried these suppressed feelings deep within me for many years, like unclaimed baggage just waiting patiently for the right moment to be unpacked and put away
 It would have been healthier if I had been able to express my anger and fear outwardly   and openly right then, once I knew and actually saw that my right foot was removed from my body permanently
 This would have allowed me to clear my innocent mind and move on in my life
 Instead, I unknowingly chose to hang on to these harmful emotions and stay stuck with them for many years to come
 Seconds after looking at my foot, a pain ignited in my lower leg and traveled to my brain like an ultra-fast railroad locomotive
 Agitated and upset, I called out for help
 They gave me something that eventually helped ease the pain
 Dr
 Green had left orders for pain medication to be administered every four hours
 However, the medication worked for only three hours, so I suffered for one very long agonizing hour after every shot wore off
 That first night was the worst
 When Dr
 Green came to check on me the next morning, I complained about my painful suffering situation
 He adjusted the amount of medication I was given and it became easier to deal with, but the next three days were still a living hell of pain
 Although the enhanced pain medication helped, I was extremely sensitive to movement--anyone's movement
 The slightest vibration from anyone walking into the room, especially near my bed, caused waves of pain to start up and move in an undulating manner up and down my leg and explode in my brain
 I had to lie perfectly still, almost frozen, to minimize the pain when I was conscious
 The pain was so absolutely horrible that when I saw the nurse coming with my injection, I flipped the sheets down and in one second, but in slow motion, had my underpants lowered with my hip exposed
 I was ready for the shot that I so desperately needed
 I had rows of puncture marks from all the shots I was receiving, so my hips began to look like a connect-the-dots picture
 When I was awake, the worst thing anyone could do to me was touch the bed
 One time, my uncle Jack walked in the room to visit and I yelled, "Stop walking, Uncle Jack!" His jaw dropped because he had never heard me yell like that, but he graciously obeyed, and like an awkward dancer he stopped in his tracks with a half twirl
 He looked at my mom with question and concern in his eyes before carefully moving over, putting the gift he had bought me on the bedside table, and then slowly moving   away
 Uncle Jack had traveled down from New Jersey to see me and have a little vacation at the same time
 I appreciated that he wanted to come see me, but I couldn't enjoy his visit during those first few days in the hospital
 I really didn't want to see anyone
 Everyone learned to move gingerly around the bed
 Eventually I recovered my manners enough to thank Uncle Jack for the big portable radio he had brought me
 My grandfather was deeply affected by all that had happened to me
 He truly was a genuinely sensitive man
 (I believe I inherited my sensitivity from Grandpa Joe
) He was remarkably compassionate as he tried to do anything he could think of to ease my discomfort
 I had been a big TV addict, so he paid to have a TV on wheels brought in for me to watch
 He knew things were bad when I had no desire to watch TV and was in too much distress to watch any of my favorite programs
 I finally began to feel better after the first couple of nights, when the strangest thing happened
 While I was sleeping on my stomach, I would find myself pulling my body toward the head of the bed because I did not feel my right foot on the surface of the sheets and thought it was hanging over the edge
 I kept pulling myself up the bed
 This happened only during the twilight of my sleep--or Twilight Zone of my sleep, more like it
 Just as strange were the aptly named phantom pains that began to develop
 I mostly felt the strange sensation of my little toe flexing and straightening and hurting in the process as if it were being squeezed at the same time
 I guess my brain was trying to become accustomed to the idea that the foot was no longer attached to my body
 This process didn't stop for a long while; it only became less intense
 The phantom pain finally went completely away after about a year
 To my happy surprise this hospital surgical visit was very short
 After ten days they took the stitches out of my perfectly performed Syme-type amputation
 Dr
 Green told me and Mom all about my (complicated) surgery the morning before I was to be discharged to go home
 I was very interested and listened to him with all my attention as he spoke
   "A long time ago, in , a pioneering Scottish surgeon, Dr
 Syme, discovered a way to remove a foot from one's leg in such a precise way as to leave the heel skin intact," he said
 "One could actually stand on the amputated limb comfortably when this special surgery was properly completed
 He created a kind of real flesh-and-blood peg leg that could literally be walked upon
 Of course, one leg then became about three inches or less shorter than the other, but this ingenious surgical technique allowed the amputee to walk and stand unassisted for short periods of time
 This would then allow for doing important things that we all take for granted, like taking a shower and making nocturnal visits to the bathroom
 Just standing unassisted or balancing on your own without crutches is very helpful
" I slowly lost my focus and was really just thinking to myself that I was separated finally from the strange destructive tumor that had invaded my healthy body and attacked me, ruining my foot and my life
 After Dr
 Green finished giving me this brief but appreciated education on the Syme amputation technique and its ultimate purpose, he went on to say more
 "The vicious tumor you had, Kevin, was called a Desmoid tumor [fibrosarcoma, Grade I]
" It actually had a name, I thought, a very curious name
 I then found myself thinking about what kind of tumor I had, because the name he had just mentioned meant nothing to me
 What was my actual situation at this time? I needed clarification
 Before he left, I asked him a question that had just hit me
 "Will I ever have cancer again at any other time in my life, Dr
 Green?" I asked cautiously
 Without hesitating, to my surprise, he replied, "You have a nine percent chance of some type of reoccurrence at some time in your life
" I thought about that for a while, feeling very disturbed
 I eventually rationalized in a very positive way that those were damn good odds and I was damn lucky
 I remembered hearing that most people have a  percent chance of getting some type of cancer at some time in their life
 I started to believe that I had gotten off easily, especially compared with other people I had seen and learned about during my time at   M
 D
 Anderson
 It was truly a great, lifesaving hospital
 I saw the reality of the saying, "It can always be worse
" Actually, the other patients whom I came to know or just observed during my frequent visits to the hospital secretly helped me get through my trauma: the beautiful girl who'd had an arm removed, the man without his lower jaw, all the patients struggling for their lives like the young man in my room whom I'd heard all about
 They, who had suffered through worse things than I had, enabled me to see how lucky I was to still have my life
 I knew I could get by somehow, and it all became a bit easier to cope with
 I was finally starting to have some continued positive thoughts, and that felt good, but it didn't last too long
 My next follow-up appointment was set for three months later
 At that time Dr
 Green would check to make sure that the remaining limb was stable and well healed from the surgery
 He had cautioned me not to walk or put any weight-bearing pressure on it until the limb was well healed and he authorized me to do so
 Dr
 Green never said anything at all about receiving an artificial limb, and Mom and I assumed that in three months I would be ready for a prosthetic device and getting one shortly thereafter
 I could have received a prosthesis much sooner, but we in a sense were misinformed without knowing it
 I would now be waiting three months
 My grandparents had driven back to Cleveland after they saw that I was improving
 They felt comfortable leaving Mom and me a few days after the surgery and left with my aunt and uncle from Israel
 Grandpa Joe and Bubbie Ida were always very caring and loving grandparents, and I have always been blessed to have them as my grandparents and as a large part of my life
 Mom and I arrived at the airport in El Paso and were greeted by my brothers and dad
 As we entered the airport terminal, Dad took one look at me as I walked along on my crutches and quickly turned away
 He began crying uncontrollably, which made me feel worse than I already did
 I guess that even though he had known what the results of my surgery would be, he wasn't ready to deal with seeing the reality of it all
 I felt physically sick in the pit of my stomach
   It was strange seeing people in the airport looking at me with questions in their eyes
 I knew they were probably wondering what had happened to this unfortunate kid as they saw the obvious emotional wrecks who were my family
 The toughest thing, though, was seeing my dad cry
 I just couldn't deal with it, although somehow I found the strength to just keep moving along like an emotionless robot
 I kept traveling along on my crutches in the little El Paso airport, all the while feeling an overwhelming sadness about the reality of my new life as an amputee and seeing it unfold in front of me in real time
 It was nighttime, and the huge windows that went all the way to the floor in the hallway caused our reflections to appear to us as we all slowly walked over to collect our luggage and then moved on to our red Ford station wagon
 While waiting to pick up the luggage, I noticed my little brother Eric looking rather disturbed
 He had an angry look on his face
 I went over to him and said, "What's up, little bro?" He looked at me with glossy eyes like he was going to cry, but he didn't
 He then said to me, "I don't like the way everyone is looking at you
" I leaned over and grabbed him affectionately by the shoulder
 "C'mon, little bro, let's go home
" We all gathered and walked out into the night, into the dry desert air of El Paso and on to the airport parking lot
 Wow, I thought
 It feels so different compared to Houston's hot, humid climate
 My brothers had no idea what to say to me
 There was an awkward silence in the car
 They tried to make some small talk and joke around about stuff
 I wasn't laughing
 I appreciated their efforts, but I was really hurting inside and my mood was pretty fixed and didn't budge, as they could easily see
 We finally got home and I went directly to my familiar perfect, peaceful, and private bedroom
 I appreciated my room in a new way
 As I lay down that night, I thought about how much I really disliked seeing people staring at me
 When I would catch them looking at me and then see them quickly look away, I felt very angry
 I deeply felt like it was an   invasion of my privacy
 I felt that people were forcing me to think of myself as an outcast, something of interest to look at but separate from the norm
 I was no longer like them, like everybody else
 I spent a lot of time in this quiet haven, my bedroom, over the next three months
 I spent way too much time hiding myself away from the world
    When I was settled in my room, I found a nice surprise
 Sitting on the table next to my bed was a brand-new black-and-white television that my dad's poker-playing buddies had bought for me
 My first cousins and other extended family in Cleveland had sent gifts and cards with nice words of concern to the house
 Stewart and Eleanor especially, and even their little sister Jenna, seemed to have taken it all pretty badly
 Later I found out more details from my mom
 Stewart, Eleanor, Jenna, and I shared Grandpa Alan and Grandma Della, as our mothers were sisters
 Their mom, my aunt Renée, was very concerned about me
 I think she was even more of a worrier than my mom
 She was the greatest aunt, though, always sending us--my brothers and me--birthday cards and gifts, as she was a good, caring aunt
 She obviously always wanted to maintain a close relationship with us, and we loved her dearly for it
 We moved away to El Paso from Cleveland when I was ten years old
 My cousins used to spend a lot of time with my brothers and me during those first ten years of our lives
 We had become quite close during that time
 My next-door neighbor, Albert, was my best friend in El Paso
 His parents came over to tell me that they had kept their son informed   of my progress while he had been on a naval submarine tour of duty for the past three months under the ocean somewhere in the world
 They were allowed to mail a type of telegram with a limited number of words to a naval office to communicate with him every so many weeks
 This "family-gram" was in turn somehow secretly radioed to the sub
 I guess it was a form of morale booster to the sailors on the huge nuclear submarine traversing the globe under the oceans for months at a time
 I was touched that they, in their limited ability to talk to their son, were including news about me
 Our next-door neighbors were definitely very nice people
 Albert's father, Albert Senior, gave me a good scolding, telling me not to let this thing--just an amputated foot--get me down
 He told me to carry on as if it was all nothing and just to get out there and continue on with my life like nothing had changed, because nothing really had
 Somehow I couldn't quite understand what he meant by all that, but I appreciated his efforts to help me out of my very visible sadness just because I saw that he was so genuinely concerned about me
 My buddy Albert was a bit wild in his overall behavior and frequently got himself into deep trouble
 That was why he ended up in the navy immediately after high school
 For example, one night after he was grounded for something serious that he had done, he sneaked out of his bedroom window to join my brother Ed and me
 We had fun in the neighborhood that night
 Albert, who was six feet tall, could buy beer for all of us, because he easily looked twenty-one years old
 As the evening progressed, he drank way too much beer
 Later, in the middle of the night, he had to crawl back out of his bedroom window again
 This time it was to vomit in his front yard so his parents wouldn't hear him
 Without realizing it, he crawled through some dog crap and got it all over himself as he worked his way back through the grass, up into his bedroom window, and back into bed
 He awoke in the morning with a lot more than a hangover
 Albert had his mother, Martha, screaming at him the loudest we had ever heard her
 She had just found him, stinking to high heaven, in a room whose noxious aroma was quickly smelling   up the whole house
 She found him in his bed, which had dog crap all over it
 It was all over Albert himself and even on the bedroom wall below the window
 This all contributed to his father giving him a kind of ultimatum about his future, and it turned out that his best choice was to go ahead and join the navy
 I think that for him, it was probably an excellent choice
 What settled me down really quickly and corrected my behavior was my foot amputation
 Things became very serious for me very quickly
 Losing a foot was like feeling a ton of bricks falling on you all at once, weighing you down and forcing you to feel helpless under there in the dark, not being able to move or even breathe
 After I returned from surgery, I discovered who my true friends were
 Only a few high school friends made sure to come and see me after they heard I was back and learned what had really happened to me apart from the rumors
 My true friends helped me a lot
 It meant so much to me when my friends visited
 I feared rejection so much that I was perfectly willing to shut myself away in the house forever
 Socializing was something I felt would only hurt me, so I wanted to push everyone away
 My few friends proved to me that my fear of rejection was unwarranted, because I could easily see that to them, I was still good old Kevin
 Obviously, to my good friends nothing really had changed about that at all
 One of my most supportive friends was Ben
 The doctor had told Mom that I should exercise my leg by swimming after we got home until we saw that it was completely healed
 However, when Mom and Dad talked to me about it, I told them there was no way in hell I was going to go out to any public place anywhere to swim
 I actually loved swimming and used to swim every chance I could, but things were different now
 I found myself prepared to give up swimming for life
 To my surprise one day, I discovered that my dad was so sensitive to my concerns (another sensitive one) that he actually bought and set up just for me a small aboveground pool in our backyard
 I was not only impressed by this pool but also extremely thankful to my parents for it
 My friend Ben came over and exercised with me a couple of times
 I was really moved by his true friendship
 He was one of a small group of the best of my friends
   My friend Tim was also a great help in my recovery
 Tim was on the wrestling team with me
 Veronica, his girlfriend, was voted the wrestling team sweetheart by our teammates, mostly because of her very persuasive promoter, Tim
 She gave me the new Ram cassette tape by Paul and Linda McCartney
 This was the latest release at the time
 I love music, and I listened to it so many times that I couldn't listen to it anymore
 Even Grand Funk Railroad, Deep Purple, and Led Zeppelin got old fast
 After the first few weeks at home, I was getting stir crazy, running out of things to do with my time
 I guess you could say I was in my own kind of Twilight Zone
 The twilight was represented by my lack of direction toward a full mental recovery of all I had just been through, and the zone was my life as it was--purposely isolated and relatively empty of anything interesting or for that matter exciting
 I attempted to read a few books, painted a few things, put together a few model cars, planes, and boats
 That was about it for quite a few weeks
 Another good friend, Larry, invited me to come over to his new apartment and stay overnight
 I was really ready to leave my bedroom out of sheer boredom by then and accepted his invitation
 When he came over and picked me up in his white Pontiac Trans Am, I started to awaken finally from my twilight sleep
 That car was a beauty, with its white paint and that awesome eagle emblem on the hood
 I flew over to it, going down my sloping driveway to the street on my crutches, which I had completely mastered by then
 The engine was running great, as I could easily tell by hearing the perfect rhythmic sound emanating from the cool-looking dual exhaust pipes as Larry started it up
 I carefully threw my crutches into the backseat and then hopped into position to slide myself into a comfortable, light blue leather bucket seat
 We cruised up the mountain over to Larry's new apartment
 What a glorious day this was developing into, I thought, as our altitude continued to increase and I breathed in the fresh mountain air
 The apartment he was renting was great--brand-new construction, all white walls, nice, light tan shag carpet--but it was sparsely furnished
 Larry said some friends of his would be coming   over later to hang around for a while
 We were then to go on to Juarez, a neighboring city in Mexico just fifteen minutes away
 We were going to a club that we went to all the time, where other friends we knew from high school hung out on weekend nights
 Suddenly I felt very queasy about being with other people socially
 Larry hadn't said anything about these plans earlier
 I had been looking forward to hanging out with Larry, but I wasn't ready to be with other people
 I didn't even have an artificial leg yet
 He saw that I wasn't thrilled about going out with other people, but it was too late to change the plans, so I just had to deal with it
 I told Larry, "I'll be fine, man; I just wish I had my artificial leg so I could look better and be able to walk around without these damn crutches
" He indicated with a simple nod that he understood my dilemma
 I went on to say to my short, slightly overweight good friend, "Larry, I just have to deal with the fact that girls will never be interested in dating a guy like me
" My friend apparently was not equipped to deal with my depressed attitude about dating and just changed the subject
 Larry's friends showed up a few minutes later
 They were a couple of guys and girls whom I had never seen before but he knew from some club he had joined
 We could hear them coming and stood to greet them, me supported by my crutches
 They all started talking and I tried very hard to be myself and fit right in with the group and all that was going on
 We all sat down
 I immediately found myself trying to hide my leg
 I wasn't sure whether I was doing that subconsciously or consciously, but it became rather annoying and I stopped
 It was pretty funny, though, when the subject of the conversation changed and we started talking about dreams
 We talked about the strange dark fears we all seem to have in our bedrooms at certain times in our lives growing up
 This one girl, Maria, said, "I used to have this fear of my hand or foot slipping over the edge of my bed during the night and being bitten off by some nightmarish creature that was after me
"   Everyone became quiet for a few seconds, and I realized what had just happened
 Maria's face turned bright red, and she could not meet my eyes
 Everyone looked at her in horror
 She looked as if she just wanted to sink into the floor and disappear
 She, and everyone else, was aghast at her insensitivity toward me
 I think she was having a problem accepting me, maybe subconsciously or maybe not
 I just had to say something to break the tension
 "You know, that's what happened to me, and look!" I said as I lifted my right leg
 No one laughed, but the situation ended
 It was finally time to go to Juarez
 I kept up with everyone on my crutches as we walked over the bridge to our neighboring country
 We went to Fred's, our bar positioned very close to the bridge for us tourists
 This had somehow become a kind of hangout for my high school
 The small, slightly air-conditioned bar had the greatest sandwiches on earth
 They always made them with this great, aromatic, freshly baked bread, sliced avocado, some hot salsa, cheese, and other great ingredient variations as well
 I always found it so dimly lit that we could barely see each other or, for that matter, what was actually in the sandwich
 That night I drank eleven shots of tequila, which was a first for me
 I was still seventeen, and in Mexico there is basically no drinking age
 If you had money and you could reach over the countertop, you could drink all you wanted, although it wasn't all that hard to drink in El Paso either
 I expressed my frustrations by drinking to excess and numbing my brain
 At the time, that was fine by me
 I was still able to somehow walk back over the bridge to El Paso on my trusty crutches
 I think this was a new world record for drunken-crutch distance bridge-walking or something like that
 I was so sick the next day from all that tequila that I knew without any question that I would not be doing that again for a seriously long time
 My good friend Larry brought me back home late the following day after I'd slept it off at his place
 I finally saw that there was life outside my bedroom, though, and I was very thankful to Larry for showing that to me
 I just needed one thing now
 I needed an artificial foot
 Unfortunately, I   had to wait until the next checkup appointment for it, and that was still two months away
 It felt like an eternity
 My birthday came in July and was pretty uneventful except for the interesting fact that now I was eighteen and had to report to a government Selective Service office
 Even though the draft had just officially ended, I still had to register; it was the law
 Larry gave me a ride to the local registration office
 I filled out all the appropriate paperwork and gave the papers to an angry-looking red-haired lady sitting behind a little desk in the front of a huge crowded room
 She thanked me as I handed her the papers
 Balancing on my crutches, with only one foot under me, I asked, "When do I get my -F classification notice or card?" She answered in a calm, rehearsed voice, "Oh, you need a doctor's note for that
" "Can't you just take a picture of me as proof of my disabled status?" I asked
 She calmly insisted, "Please bring a doctor's note
" I got the message, but I wonder if she really saw me
 I went immediately over to Dr
 Goldner's office, as it was only a few blocks away
 He came out to talk to me in the waiting room after seeing his patients
 He literally laughed out loud when he heard about the government's request for a medical note proving my right foot had been amputated
 He continued laughing as he said, "Just give me a minute" and wrote the note
 I immediately brought the note back to the same lady and thus completed my requirement as an eighteen-year-old American citizen
 I completed the registration for possible future military duty and was duly registered on July , 
 To my surprise, because of all this I was feeling a bit important that day
 I often felt and said that I was such a wild soul in my youth, before I lost my foot, that if I had ever gone into the military, I probably would have gotten into a lot of trouble
 I most likely would never have come back from overseas duty because I would be hiding from the military authority way up in the mountains somewhere with two beautiful Asian women who loved me
 I would be living on a farm, raising buffalos and having the time of my life
   I'll tell you, my attitude changed a lot about my life as it used to be
 One day in my small bedroom, I was feeling quite depressed
 I had just realized that I had started disliking all sports
 I discovered that I never watched them with my family on TV at all anymore
 My family all loved to see sporting events and could watch the stuff all weekend long
 Forget about participating in any sports; you could never win at anything now
 I realized that I was thinking this while watching TV
 I rationalized that my behavior came from having these excellent athletes remind me too much of what I had lost
 It hurt
 I had always been a very competitive person, but those days were over for me
 Then I started thinking about the ladies
 How could I ever attract a girlfriend? Who could be interested in a guy with one foot? Would I ever have a girlfriend holding my hand? A date? I even wondered if I would ever find myself taking a shower with one--can you believe it? I began immediately thinking about how an artificial limb replacement could improve my life, and to what degree
 I need this artificial limb experience to unfold as soon as possible, I thought
 I need to learn all I can about it
 I need an artificial limb now! I couldn't wait any longer for the opportunity to check out the whole experience of artificial limb wearing and walking
 I just realized that I knew absolutely nothing about it
    The next time we visited Dr
 Green in Houston, he examined my leg and pronounced it perfectly healed
 He told me to go home and return in six months
 I was surprised and disappointed that he was dismissing me out of hand, without even mentioning when I would get my artificial foot
 "When am I getting an artificial limb?" I demanded, the emotions churning in my stomach, making me feel a bit queasy
 "You mean no one has arranged that for you yet?" he exclaimed
 My mother and I just looked at each other
 Neither one of us knew what to say
 After all, how should we have known what to do? "I will get an appointment set up for you at the local prosthetics facility near the hospital complex
 I am sure they will be able to help you out and see you today," Dr
 Green offered as he left us to make the phone call
 My heart was pounding because this was so important to me
 It's all going to start today, finally! I thought
 When he returned, Dr
 Green told my mom the appointment was set and that they would "take good care of Kevin
" I still knew nothing about how artificial feet were made and how they worked, and as a result, I felt tremendous anxiety about it all
 I did know that an artificial limb would be a chance to move   about in this world without being seen as a deformed or abnormal person
 I very much wanted my privacy back in that respect
 I just wanted to fit in
 Fitting in became a bit more difficult for me because of my four great years of art classes that I had enjoyed very much
 I had learned a lot about beauty and gained an appreciation for looking at things with an understanding that was greater than merely seeing what was on the surface
 I was one of three students who had been considered to have natural artistic abilities and were taught separately from the rest of the students for all four high school years
 We had been discovered in our freshman year by our cool art teacher, Mrs
 Heart
 Her knowledge of art and her ability to pass it on to us was truly a gift
 We took full advantage of what she had to offer
 As we studied great paintings and sculptures, I was taught to see the human body as a beautiful thing
 As a result of my excellent art education, it was extremely difficult to accept seeing the human body mutilated in various ways
 It was especially hard to accept what had been done to my own body
 In addition to all the people I had seen during my hospital experiences, I remembered seeing a disabled veteran who liked to park his wheelchair next to the downtown movie theater in El Paso
 He would just sit in his wheelchair smoking a cigarette and holding a cup filled with pencils and little American flags that he would sell
 He had no legs at all
 I remember thinking that he looked terrible, and I wondered why he was subjecting us to the sight of him, a deformed human being with absolutely no legs
 He should disappear from our sight because we would prefer not to see him at all
 I had thought this back when I had two whole legs and was much younger
 Well, now I felt like he was my brother and he had my full respect
 My appearance was devoid of any kind of beauty
 I wondered how an artificial limb or prosthetic device would help this sad situation, but I couldn't wait to get one to see if I could then begin to feel whole again, and intact
 We traveled to the prosthetics facility immediately
 As I looked around in my usual investigative way, I noticed that a thin film of   dust seemed to cover everything
 Sitting in this dimly lit brown waiting room, we filled out papers as we sat and smelled traces of a plastic odor
 Included in the paperwork was something interesting: an application form from a special funding organization called Vocational Rehabilitation
 They might possibly agree to pay for my new prosthesis
 My anxiety level stayed high as I waited, though
 I still had no idea what was going to happen next
 Finally we were brought in, as we were told, for the first step, the evaluation
 The prosthetist, Mr Hall, looked at my amputated leg with curious intent as he made notes and took measurements with a measuring tape
 He measured my leg as if he were going to make clothes for it
 He measured the length of both legs from the knee down, and then circumference measurements every couple of inches all the way down to the bottom end
 My good foot was measured for its size
 He actually made marks on my skin with a special pen as he precisely measured my remaining leg
 He pushed his chubby finger into what remained of my right leg all around the bottom, pushing on the bones and soft flesh as well
 He then asked me this strange question: "Kevin, what would you like to do after you receive your prosthesis, your new leg?" "I want to do everything I did before," I replied
 I thought to myself, What does he expect me to say? "You will be able to do everything you did before," Mr Hall offered, "but just not as well
" I figured he was trying to get me to begin developing a more realistic picture of what I should expect
 Hall asked Mom, "Where are you folks from?" Mom said, "We're from El Paso, sir
" He got up and left the room abruptly, which had me very worried
 He returned a short time later
 Sitting back down in front of us he said, "We will make the prosthesis for you as fast as possible to accommodate you folks since you don't live in the area
" That news made me very happy
 He then added, "The state program Vocational Rehabilitation will be paying for the prosthesis for you, in full," and that news made my mother very happy
 He continued smiling from ear to ear
 "In just three to four days I will have a finished prosthesis for you
" I was so ecstatic, I thought I would explode
   I cooperated fully as Mr Hall started the next step, the casting procedure, and began to make a plaster mold of my leg that he called the "negative mold
" "Kevin, you need to keep perfectly still now, until the plaster sets up," he directed
 I didn't move
 I was cooperating as best I could to help him create the absolute best artificial leg he possibly could for me
 I was focused, even though the plaster had a distracting terrible odor and felt cold and slimy
 After a relatively short time it started to heat up slowly as it began to stiffen
 Hall explained, "I will use this mold to make your leg
 I will pour liquid plaster into it to make what we call the `positive mold
' Then the actual prosthetic device will be designed from this positive mold after I make some very complicated adjustments to its shape
" He told me to relax as he slipped the negative mold off my sweating leg
 He looked inside the mold and studied it from all different angles before declaring, "Kevin, you did a great job--this will work
" He set the mold down
 "We will call you to come back for the next step, what we call a `test socket fitting' and a `static and dynamic alignment' of the prosthetic foot
 The finished leg will be ready the next day after all the necessary adjustments are completed
" My mother and I came back two days later for the fitting and alignment procedure
 I was a nervous wreck as I sat in this long room with parallel bars bolted to the floor and full-length mirrors on either end
 How can I do this? Will I be able to control this new leg the way I need to? How will it keep from coming off? Can I make it all work out? I just don't know
 Will it hurt? Will it look good? I was afraid, bursting with all these questions flooding my mind
 Mr. Hall came into the room with a very serious and uneasy look on his plump face
 He had the artificial limb with him
 It looked absolutely terrible
 It looked like a tree trunk, except it was the length of my leg from my ankle to my knee
 It was smooth and skin colored and shaped just like a tree trunk with a foot literally glued onto it, sticking out the end
 My stomach was doing flips
 How could I be getting such an ugly-looking leg like that, damn it! I held it together and lied to myself, saying, I don't care how it   looks because my pants will cover it and no one will actually see it
 This thought helped
 M  Hall proceeded to put a sock on my skin and slowly slipped the prosthesis on me
 "Okay, Kevin, stand up but mainly with your weight on your good leg, and slowly ease your weight onto the prosthesis until you have an approximate equal weight on both of your legs
" I robotically moved as he instructed and then began to feel the pressure squeezing all around my leg
 I was standing on two legs for the first time in months, and it truly felt great to have that sense of perfect balance again
 Jim--Mr Hall--then instructed me, saying, "Step out with your good foot, Kevin, and bring it right back to the same starting point under your body
 Do this a couple of times as you put some weight on the prosthesis
 This will allow you to rock on your prosthetic foot to get a feel for how it will bend under your weight
" Okay, I thought, and I did exactly what Jim asked very mechanically
 I was just starting to get comfortable when he instructed, "Take a step with the prosthesis--now, Kevin!" I began to walk, but Mom was freaking me out because I saw her immediately start to cry
 I started walking with both hands clinging to the parallel bars, then only my left hand, and then no hands
 I saw that I had the strength in my amputated leg to control the prosthesis as my weight shifted back and forth from leg to leg
 I was walking, I was walking, I was walking again! As I walked along within those bars, turning as I reached the end and then walking back, my mind flashed with such an exciting feeling, it's difficult to express
 I guess I would have to describe it as the feeling of successful relief
 A weight was lifted, and the anxiety disappeared from my mind
 I physically felt the pressure of my body's weight all around my leg as it was forced into this custom-made container called the "socket
" To my great happiness I found that it did not hurt at all; it just felt a bit tight
 I was walking
 I just loved it
 Mom was crying
 My prosthetist, Jim, gave us some advice before we left the facility
 "When you take the prosthesis the first day, don't walk too much, because your knee joint will become very sore since you   haven't walked with it for so many months
" Jim went on to say, "The rest of your leg that fits down in the prosthesis could also get very sore from all the pressure on the skin
 Your skin is absolutely not accustomed to all this pressure
 The alignment looks very good, you're demonstrating great balance and control--now the next step is to just finish it
" I asked in a very humble way, "Mr Hall, sir, could you make the leg look better?" "Kevin, please call me Jim
 We will be getting to know each other quite well over the next few days
" He must have sensed my sadness about the prosthesis's overall poor appearance, because he took the time to explain to me why it looked so bad
 He said calmly, "This type of leg, your first one, always looks like this--big--although I will try to make it look better, the best that I can
 "You see, the device is big looking because you have some swelling in your remaining limb
 I had to leave room inside the socket for you to wear a prosthetic sock to protect your skin, plus you have to account for the thickness of the plastic of the device on top of all that
 The combination of all these things makes the leg too big
 I promise that as the swelling goes down and the remaining muscles shrink, your future prosthetic limbs will begin to look better, much closer to the correct size
 Your actual remaining limb will become smaller over the next two years, allowing your future limbs to be made smaller
 Then it will be easy to always make your prosthetic limb look better, more natural in its appearance
" "Why will my muscles become smaller?" I asked
 He went on patiently, "Now that your foot and ankle are gone, the muscles that you used to control them are really of no use to you anymore, so they will atrophy or slowly shrink away
 This is a totally normal process
" I didn't like the sound of that, but the knowledge that the prosthesis would look better cosmetically somehow made it seem okay
 After all, the muscles are now of no use to me, I thought
 Jim said to us, "You can pick up the finished prosthesis tomorrow afternoon
"   Wow, tomorrow; this was totally awesome! As we left the clinic and waited for the bus to show up, I was smiling at the fact that I had actually walked on my prosthesis and had done it very well, especially for the first time
 Jim had been very impressed with my good sense of balance and the strength in my legs
 We took a bus to shop for some baggy pants that would fit over the prosthesis
 Luckily baggy pants were in fashion and this type was abundant, so we purchased a few pair
 The next day I did have a sore knee, but it wasn't bad at all and improved quickly
 The excitement of getting my leg that day trumped anything negative that could be affecting me
 We returned as requested to receive my prosthesis and also a supply of special prosthetic socks
 We were also given detailed instructions from Jim--or should I say, guidelines
 Jim directed, "Be careful, Kevin, about what shoes you buy in the future, because the prosthesis was made for one specific heel height, the height of the heel on the shoes you're wearing now
 If you wear shoes with a higher heel, they will tip you forward and you won't like how that will affect your balance
 You will be forced to walk like you're being pushed downhill
 If the heel is lower, it won't be quite as bad, but you'll feel like you're being forced to walk uphill all day, and you won't like that either
" What a lot to remember, I thought; I'd worry about all that later
 I just wanted to take off walking, enjoying every proud step
 Jim told us to call him if we had any problems or questions
 Mom and I thanked Jim, me with a handshake and Mom with a big, big hug
 Mom thanked Jim for all he had done
 Thanks to Jim's great help, we were now ready to go back home to El Paso
 I was going to be able to walk off the plane when we arrived as a whole person, just like everyone else
 It was absolutely awesome
 I was feeling very happy
 I would be walking now with a fresh sense of appreciation for having the simple ability to walk once more, something that I had always taken for granted but absolutely never would again
 I was extremely determined to walk so well that people would never think I was walking on an artificial foot and ankle
    I loved walking and had a new sense of appreciation for this reacquired skill
 Not only could I walk again, but I could balance myself easily standing on two feet and walk effortlessly while carrying things
 Best of all, no one had a clue I was an amputee
 I went on long walks and did quite well
 The only difficulty I encountered was that the muscles of my good leg, specifically my shin muscles on the front of my lower leg, became very sore during these long, fast walks
 Those muscles were being overworked to the point that they were straining and hurting
 I learned that those muscles were the ones that pulled my foot back up as I propelled forward and pushed off my toes when I walked especially fast
 All my leg muscles had to do the work of both legs because the artificial foot was incapable of propelling me forward at all
 Unfortunately the artificial foot had no motor in it, just a simple reinforced rubber toe
 My good leg was the motor, so I quickly learned that I had to strengthen it, which I did over time, and things improved
 I even bravely jumped into our repaired  Volkswagen Beetle one day and taught myself how to drive the "Bug" with its clutch, brake, and gas pedals
 The first time I told my brother Ed that I had driven the car, he kind of freaked out a bit and asked me how I was   doing it
 "Let's go for a drive and I'll show you," I sneered deviously trying to unnerve Ed, showing my teeth and moving my eyebrows up and down--and off we went
 I was making up for lost time
 I showed Ed how I used the heel of the artificial foot on the gas and the brake pedals as necessary and used my left foot on the clutch
 My shifting wasn't very smooth, but I was driving again and figured my shifting finesse would come in time, as did Ed
 I learned to walk so well on the prosthesis that my friends and family were amazed
 I was very happy to have this artificial limb and to become independently mobile again
 My world was opening
 I could enjoy it and live in it again because of my new limb
 My new leg also fascinated me
 Night after night I would lie in bed and study the artificial limb from all angles, trying to figure out how it was made
 I was trying to understand or figure out how it had replaced my diseased foot
 I found myself wondering at times why it looked different on the inside and had a totally different shape from the outside
 Most of all I speculated about just how it was actually fabricated
 Jim could have attached the rubber foot in a different place
 Why had he put it specifically where he had? My mind was so stimulated by these questions that I asked them of myself over and over again
 I just had this need to figure it all out, as I did about most things that interested me
 I decided the only way to really understand it all would be to get a part-time job in a place that manufactured artificial limbs, a prosthetics lab
 I figured I would do this at some time in the near future and see how I might like it as a possible career
 As Jim had predicted, my remaining limb did get smaller about a month and a half later; it began to literally shrink in size
 I began developing problems with this first artificial limb quite soon after I received it
 The fit of the prosthesis became very loose, losing support all around the sides of the socket, and made me take all the weight-bearing pressure right on the bottom of my remaining leg
 I started developing pain as the bottom of my leg started pressing with way too much pressure up against that hard plastic that made up the bottom of the prosthetic socket
 The pain felt as if I had a   pebble in my shoe for a whole day and couldn't take it out
 I ignored it as long as I could until about two o'clock in the afternoon
 Then it started getting worse, but I just continued to ignore the pain until seven o'clock at night
 Then I finally took my shoe off, but it was so sore that it kept hurting just as if I were still standing and walking on that pebble in my shoe
 Hours later it would begin to settle down and go away during the night, only to start the whole cycle again the next morning
 Finally I called Jim, my prosthetist, in Houston
 With panic in my voice I said, "I can't walk on my prosthesis anymore without it hurting! I can't use it anymore to walk!" I was working hard trying not to cry about it all and become uncontrollably emotional
 I desperately did not want to lose my mobility and independence
 Jim was very calm
 "Go to a local limb shop in El Paso for adjustments and have them tighten the fit appropriately for you
 They could adjust the fit for you and make it feel much more comfortable
 By adding padding to the inside walls in various positions, the fit can be adjusted, increasing your comfort level
 You'll see, Kevin; they will be able to help you
" Jim was very reassuring
 He must have heard the panic in my voice as I complained to him, but he was quite patient with me on the phone
 He went on to say, "What you are experiencing is perfectly normal and is all part of adjusting to one's first prosthesis
 Better times are coming, because the shrinking process will begin to slow down soon and the proper fit of your future prosthetic limbs will last much longer
" I asked, "How long will the shrinking process take?" "Remember, I said plan on having extreme shrinking going on for the next eighteen months to two years
 Your leg won't actually be considered stable until about two years from the time of the amputation," he replied
 I couldn't believe that my leg was going through so much that it would take two years to completely heal
 Jim went on to say, "In the future you will easily be able to go eight to nine months without needing any adjustments at all, when your leg stabilizes
 You might just need simple adjustments that   you can do yourself, such as wearing different thicknesses of socks in various combinations to tighten the fit as your leg continues to slowly shrink
 Understand that a ten-pound weight gain or loss could begin to affect the comfort of the prosthesis also
 "Try adjusting the socks first to see if that helps improve the fit
 If you can't find a comfortable combination of socks, go to your local prosthetics facility, and call me if you have any more questions or concerns
" I felt so much better after talking to Jim, like my life had just been restored or saved
 I now knew the whole story about comfortable walking and prosthetic maintenance, and most of all, I knew that better times were coming
 I had made it approximately a month and a half after the time of my call to Jim by just adjusting my socks, but now the fit of this first prosthesis really started hurting bad again and I just couldn't adjust it to get it fitting comfortably
 It was definitely time to get some professional local help
 My father found a prosthetics facility in town, and we made an appointment
 I was a little apprehensive as we approached this not-tooimpressive-looking prosthetics facility
 We entered the glass storefront with retail stores on either side
 It was not very clean and looked somewhat disorganized
 There was no sense that we were in a medical-related facility
 Boxes of all types were stacked in every available corner in the large front waiting area
 The reception desk was empty, void of a receptionist
 We saw a little chrome bell on the desk's corner and Dad rang it a couple of times
 Mr
 Tormento finally came out from a back room and greeted us
 I found him to be an overweight middle-aged man, with almost no hair on his head
 I noticed that he did not smile
 We were asked politely to follow him into a small examination room with a curtain that would close for privacy
 He almost immediately told us that my prosthesis needed to be replaced
 "The remaining limb has just shrunk too much for the prosthesis to be tightened enough for a proper fit," he advised
 "We really need to replace it now
" My new limb maker, or prosthetist, Mr
 Tormento, took some measurements, and then looked directly at my dad as he quoted   the price of a new limb
 "I can provide this young man with a new limb for three hundred and eighty-one dollars," he said
 He made payment arrangements with my father, who suddenly became a bit more nervous
 When I received my new prosthesis a few weeks later, I was delighted to see that it was smaller in circumference than the first one
 It definitely looked much better and did not resemble a tree trunk quite as much
 However, this one was aligned poorly and hurt every time I took it off
 There was some kind of hidden edge near the bottom of the socket inside that cut into me every time I removed the limb
 It was my impression that Mr
 Tormento was not as skilled as Jim at making artificial limbs
 He seemed to be incapable of correcting these problems even though he attempted to do so several times at my request
 I was very angry
 I had trusted that he would provide me with a proper-fitting prosthesis and he hadn't
 I considered just leaving the leg on at night and never taking it off to avoid this awful pain as I tried to scrape the bone past the elusive ridge to get the leg off
 One night I became so desperate to avoid that damn pain that I did try sleeping with it on all night
 It was terribly uncomfortable, and there was a tremendous sweat buildup
 Sleeping with the artificial leg on would be like sleeping with your shoes on
 Sure, you could do it, but it wouldn't be very comfortable
 I went back several more times and Mr
 Tormento couldn't figure out what was wrong
 He could not fix it, and he refused to make it over again
 He actually said I would eventually get used to it
 I didn't adjust
 My hip hurt because the improper alignment put a constant strain on my hip joint
 The prosthetic foot was positioned improperly and broke after a relatively short period of time
 The foot was replaced only because it was under the manufacturer's warranty
 I was glad that the company that made this particular style of lousy prosthetic foot was able to replace it; however, it just broke again in a few weeks
 The foot had some kind of a metal plate in the middle of the toe area that snapped in half and made a clicking noise when I walked
 It wasn't too loud, but it clicked all day long
 Most of the   time it didn't bother me while walking except when I finally went on a date
 It was my first date since the surgery
 Julie was beautiful, blonde, and built
 As I walked Julie to her front door, all you heard was click, click, and click
 It seemed that my car was parked miles from her door, not just on the street in front of her house
 The night was so quiet that the click of my foot seemed to echo throughout the neighborhood
 The noise ruined the romantic ending of our date that I had been really looking forward to all evening
 I was so embarrassed
 Julie was so nice to me
 She pretended not to hear the click, click, click as we strolled along, even though it was such an obvious noisy interruption on that quiet desert night
 She invited me to come by sometime and listen to music together with her, and you know I did
 That atrocious prosthetic device and how it nearly ruined my evening made one thing crystal clear: it was time to get a part-time job at a prosthetics manufacturing lab
 I had two reasons for wanting to do this
 First, I wanted to learn how to make artificial limbs that didn't make noise on quiet romantic nights while hurting your hip as you struggled to walk and scraping the bone every time you tried to remove it
 Second, and probably most important, I wanted to learn how to make a perfect one for myself, one that made walking a pleasure, as it should be--not a nightmare!    Losing my foot helped me clarify my career goals
 I already knew that I did not want to do what my family had planned for me
 My uncle Jack had his dental practice in Florida and wanted my brothers and me to move there and work as dentists for him
 That was the last thing on my list
 The state of Texas determined that I was disabled, so I qualified for a program that helped disabled people get jobs
 Under this program, called Vocational Rehabilitation, the same one that paid for my first prosthesis, I could go to college for free if I passed an aptitude test
 If I qualified, the only things I would have to pay for were books, food, transportation, and room and board
 I had to take the test because my high school grades were not exceptionally good; in fact they were rather poor
 I agreed to take the test
 The results showed all my weak areas of educational study--or more accurately, lack of study
 No one who was involved in this process was surprised at the final results
 My high school grades mirrored the test scores
 I had poor English grammar, math skills, spelling skills, and reading skills
 After years of hearing from my parents and teachers that my school grades would affect my future, I finally realized what they were trying to tell me
 How I wished I had done better!   The IQ test that they insisted I take showed that I could do anything I wanted if I just put my full efforts into it and worked hard
 The vocational office through my assigned counselor agreed to give me a chance because my IQ score was quite high
 The letter they sent me explained what they were willing to do for me at this time
 I was happy that I had a chance, a great chance, as I started my first semester in college at the University of Texas at El Paso
 In , I decided to try to get a part-time job, working in a business that made artificial limbs
 I figured that I could work whenever I wasn't in class, and I hoped my future employer would be amenable to such a schedule
 After school started, I arranged to be interviewed at the two other prosthetics facilities in El Paso
 I was hired immediately at the first place I walked into
 I agreed to sign a paper that allowed the facility owner to pay me only $
 an hour because I was a disabled employee
 Minimum wage as it was tied to the cost of living was now up to $
 per hour
 I was a bargain for William Buckeye, the owner, and that's the reason he hired me so fast
 It had just happened that year: the Rehabilitation Act of  became a law to encourage the economic independence of people with disabilities
 I felt Mr
 Buckeye really used this to his advantage
 In college, I quickly became a popular student
 My popularity wasn't because of my fantastic personality alone; it may have been caused just a little bit by the fact that I had in my possession a very valuable disabled-driver sticker
 This enabled me to drive anywhere on the expansive college campus and park in choice spots
 Everyone wanted to ride with me after they discovered my luxury
 I had a few dates, some that went rather well and a few that didn't
 One date in particular stands out in my mind
 We were at the local drive-in theater when my date, Rebecca, decided to show me where her cousin had broken her leg
 She grabbed my right leg in the approximate location of the break as we sat cozily in the front seat
 As she made contact with the hard plastic under my pant leg, her expression grew confused as she proceeded to frantically feel up and down my leg, searching for a physical explanation
 She gave up trying to figure out what she was feeling and asked me about it
 I   explained to her that I had an artificial limb and proceeded to try to tell her all about my foot amputation
 As I spoke, she actually slid away from me on the car seat
 She reacted like a real first-class jerk
 She became quiet and behaved like a completely different person
 I took her home directly after the movie ended because I knew that was what she wanted
 I tried calling her once after that just to make sure she was really dumping me just because of my leg
 She refused to even come to the phone to speak to me
 Even though I tried not to let this bother me too much, it hurt an incredible amount
 I can honestly say that at that point in my life, I had very little experience with dealing with outright rejection
 Later, after dwelling on this situation way too long, I decided that my leg would be a personality filter
 Yes, it would prevent me from wasting my time talking to or being with shallow-minded, insensitive, superficial jerks
 I didn't ask to have my foot amputated, and I knew that I was much more than just a guy with a missing foot
 I wouldn't let other people look at me like that
 After I completed my first semester, I had worked in the limb shop enough to learn that this work demanded plenty of hands-on experience if I wanted to become great at it--and I did
 At first I found it very difficult to look at other people's amputations
 I was very self-conscious about looking at their limbs even though I needed to look at them as well as touch them to know how to fabricate a prosthesis for them properly
 Each amputated limb looked different
 I saw amputations at all levels; below the knee, above the knee, below the elbow, above the elbow, fat legs, and emaciated skinny limb shapes
 All were very strange to see for the first time
 I adjusted to this difficulty much faster than I thought would be possible
 I even started to become interested in learning how to make artificial arms
 I was maturing and was able to look at things from a professional point of view
 I was extremely pleased with myself for this major accomplishment
 I felt the best course of action for my career would be to attend college at night and work full time in the limb shop
 I was continuing to see that in order to obtain the very high level of skills I wanted to reach, part-time work would   never be enough
 I was confident that I could do this work and do it well
 I had a steadfast determination to be successful and become an excellent prosthetist
 I was very fortunate to have made my career choice by the time I was nineteen
 Vocational Rehabilitation agreed to continue to pay for my college courses at night and would consider paying for specialized courses at a different college if I qualified and the courses were not offered locally
 I worked at this El Paso prosthetics facility about a year
 I began to discover that my boss, William (or Bill), would never let me continue to develop my prosthetics skills
 I was kept doing the same fabrication work that a technician does, and I wasn't being offered the opportunity I needed to spend much more time with the patients
 I required the opportunity to observe and participate in more direct patient contact, enabling me to continue the learning process and develop my prosthetics skills
 I decided to seek other employment options in El Paso
 There were not many
 I did get a new job offer at the only other facility (of the three) available and began to work straight away for this family-owned practice
 They didn't have a long waiting list of job applicants; this I'm sure helped me get the job so quickly
 My new immediate boss, Melvin Phoenix, agreed to give me the patient contact experience that I needed and wanted
 I felt ready after about three months of working for Melvin, and decided to apply to the University of California at Los Angeles
 I wanted to attend their prosthetics certificate program
 To my great surprise, my application was accepted
 The certificate class was to start October  and end on October  of the year 
 I found out later that I had been the youngest applicant for a prosthetics certificate course that they had ever had before
 They were kind of experimenting with me
 The state agreed to pay only for the Below Knee Prosthetics course tuition
 I had to pay all other expenses
 My parents helped out with the rest of the arrangements
 I was still living at home, so my only expense was my car payments for my new metallic-green, four-cylinder Pinto
 I would drive to Los Angeles and stay with my aunt Molly and uncle Woody
 I felt I was on my way to fulfilling my dream of being a prosthetist, which had become something I truly wanted to do
   Early in the morning on the first day of class, I was driving down a beautiful wide road framed with mammoth tall palm trees on either side
 Today I was on my way, I thought
 My professional academic career was about to officially begin
 As the song "Mr
 Bojangles" began to play on the radio, I thought that I would always remember this joyful anticipation of success every time I heard it in the future
 I found the school but panicked when I realized that I had no idea how to find the prosthetics department, and this medical campus was unbelievably huge
 I asked for directions at the bookstore
 The clerk told me how to get there, and after I thanked him, I flew across the sprawling campus to the prosthetics department
 I could not be late on this most important first day
 Class started with lectures on what was expected of us during this short-term course on below-the-knee prosthetics
 They even scheduled us for an actual amputation surgery because a procedure popular at the time included what was called an immediate post-operative fitting
 This involved putting a plaster-fabricated socket directly onto the remaining below-the-knee amputated limb or above-the-knee amputated limb
 Padding was also applied, as well as suspension straps and an adjustable pylon with a simple rubber foot attached
 This was all done very quickly after the surgery while the patient was still in the operating room
 A professor informed us that it was mandatory that we all observe an amputation surgery
 What did he say? That is just going to be way too intense for me to see--actual surgery! I wondered how I was going to handle it
 I found myself becoming extremely nervous as the amputation day approached
 Well, the day finally came when our surgery lesson was going to happen, and I did what I had to do
 It turned out to be kind of cool to learn appropriate surgical room behavior and to actually see the amputation technique performed before our eyes, but this was extremely intense stuff
 I found myself thinking about this doctor's incredible responsibility as he ordered the operating room staff around
   In the middle of that night I woke up sweating
 I had had an unbelievable dream
 I had dreamed that I was in class having a conversation with someone for a few minutes
 When I decided to turn around and finish talking, I realized that the man I was talking to had no head, only a suture line across his shoulders
 That happened only once, for which I am quite thankful
 I awoke one other night, but that was for a completely different reason
 There was an earthquake around : a
m
 that actually shook the house
 I realized what had awakened me when I heard about it on the news driving to school later in the morning
 I survived and successfully completed the course and drove myself all the way back home across the deserts of the Southwest
 Aunt Molly and Uncle Woody packed not one, not two, but three perfect salami sandwiches for my drive back to El Paso
 I have always been eternally grateful for their very kind hospitality and honest concern for my well-being
 I reapplied for the next certificate course at UCLA but didn't get in quite so easily this time
 They said they had to accept people with higher educational credentials first and I was at the end of a long list, even though I had done well the first time
    I was disappointed that I could not continue my education immediately
 The slow performance of my car was an additional frustration
 I hated driving it back and forth to work, and I especially disliked driving the slow-moving vehicle on the weekends
 My four-cylinder Pinto was just too slow and not very exciting to drive
 Since my boss, Melvin, raced a front-engine top-fuel rail dragster in competition as a hobby, I asked his advice one day about getting a better car
 "Sell your car and get the only American sports car, the Chevrolet Corvette
" Wow, what a super great idea
 I'll do it! I thought
 I couldn't wait to sell my car, as this was the first step toward getting a super sports car
 I wanted to make sure to get the best price possible for it, so I decided to use all my free time wisely, cleaning my car and preparing it for sale
 After cleaning and waxing the Pinto's exterior, I used powdered cleanser and even scrubbed all the seats, door panels, and dashboard until they all looked brand new
 I was exhausted after all this work, but the car looked great
 The first guy who saw it gave me my asking price, saying that the car was worth the money because it was so clean
 I learned something that day: hard work does pay--and very well
   Through the newspaper, I found a  Corvette Stingray (ragtop) convertible for sale
 I fell in love with this car at first sight
 The body style was magnificent, a real work of art
 The only problem was that I needed an additional seven hundred dollars to pay for it
 My dad took me to his banker, and the bank to my great surprise lent the money to me
 Mr
 Wilson, the banker, advised, "Kevin, I am impressed with your knowledge that you could increase the car's value by fixing it up
 I can tell you have a good work ethic, and I'm investing in you as much as I am in the car
" I did it--I was getting that Corvette! Three days after buying the car, I had a freak accident while stopped at a light getting ready to make a right-hand turn
 The car was completely smashed on the front driver's side, making it impossible to drive
 It needed nine hundred dollars' worth of repairs
 I had to move back home from the apartment that I shared with my best friend, Albert, so I could save money to get the car fixed
 My boss said if I followed his instructions, he would help me rebuild the car completely into whatever I wanted
 I listened to him and took advantage of the car's demolished state
 I had the frame straightened and took everything apart, except for the transmission
 I brought the engine parts to a race shop where they balanced the crankshaft, bored out the cylinders, and put the pushrods back together in a special way with a torch
 I watched them do some of the work, and it was quite interesting
 The mechanic heated the pushrod until the hole, which made up the top, actually expanded before my eyes
 He then carefully positioned the pin that went through the piston head and held the pushrod and joined them together
 He just held everything in position until the pushrod cooled, and locked the three pieces together as one unit
 This way there were no scratches made on any of the moving parts during the assembly process that would slow the performance of the engine
 When the engine was ready to be rebuilt, Melvin told me that he would put it together for me at his house and install it back into the car at my house
 While all this was going on, I ordered a new complete front end that was designed to tilt up away from the front windshield over the front tires
 With a little guidance from some car   body experts I had found, I installed the front-end body unit onto the car myself, setting it a little lower on the frame
 It really looked awesome! The engine had become a  instead of a , and with the  Camaro camshaft my boss advised me to get, the engine sounded extremely radical
 The engine was finally ready to be put back in
 First I needed to get new wheels and tires installed so my boss could test-drive the car after putting the engine in
 We needed to make sure the clutch and everything was working okay
 Luckily my grandparents and uncle were in town for a visit and saw the car up on blocks
 They wanted to know why it was in such a state
 My father told them about my little mishap
 They each kicked in some money so I was able to get the outrageous wide aluminum wheels and the tires I wanted
 I'll always remember that, and how they came through for me
 Melvin showed up one exciting Saturday morning to put that awesome engine back where it belonged
 I watched him spend many hours getting it installed properly and ready to start
 After Melvin cranked the engine (without the radiator), he actually drove it down the street, trying to pop wheelies with it as he drove it back and forth
 He finally stopped before the intense heat buildup in the engine did any damage
 The engine was performing perfectly! I sanded the entire car body by hand and sprayed it with dark gray primer
 It was now ready to drive
 I did install the radiator with a custom apron attached that I constructed out of fiberglass myself
 This was necessary to keep that giant engine running cool as I raced around in the hot El Paso sun
 The car was outrageous
 My friends would call me to see if they could go cruising around town with me on Friday and Saturday nights in my awesome convertible sports car
 It was a nice feeling, being popular for something
 I had a lot of fun in that car and was proud of it; it was a good-looking car
 I had no idea how mechanically minded I really was until after that car rebuilding and repairing experience I enjoyed so much
 I applied to Northwestern University in Chicago since it felt like UCLA had abandoned me
 I had heard nothing from them in quite   a while
 One morning in late , I was standing across the large workbench in the main fabrication room when I was begrudgingly instructed that someone was calling me during office hours
 I hesitantly picked up the gray phone conveniently attached at the corner leg of the table near the hallway
 To my complete surprise I was told that I had been accepted into Northwestern's long-term certificate program
 I was also told that the invitation hinged on the tuition being paid in full before the program started, on January , 
 I was asked if I could raise approximately three thousand dollars to cover the cost
 I asked the person at the registration office to please hold my spot because I was going to attend no matter what, and assured her that I would send the tuition money before the deadline
 I had absolutely no idea where I would get the money, though
 The admissions people at Northwestern were impressed that I had successfully completed the Below Knee course at UCLA, and that's why they were offering me this opportunity to attend their new long-term program
 When I completed this six-month program, I would be in a position to qualify for the American Board for Certification in Orthotics and Prosthetics examination
 When I passed, I would be a certified prosthetist, or C
P
 Curiously, neither Melvin nor his younger brother Ralph seemed very excited about my fantastic educational opportunity when I excitedly shared my great news
 I figured that Melvin thought he might be losing his star employee in January and possibly even permanently after the program ended in June
 Ralph, on the other hand, I am sure was thinking he would have to carry the load--you know, pick up the slack, so to speak--if I wasn't around
 He just might have to work a bit harder, something he obviously was not interested in, since it was, you know, work
 I just shrugged off their unhealthy attitude, because I was way, way too excited
 I felt like I would literally jump out of my boots! I told my mom and dad, who did not have the money I needed, that somehow I was going to Chicago, because there was no way I was passing up this opportunity
 Next I set up an appointment with the counselor at the state Vocational Rehabilitation office to see if   he could help me finish my prosthetics education
 My counselor, Tom, said he could not authorize that kind of money for a onetime tuition expense
 I was upset, of course, but he immediately said, with a thoughtful smile on his face, "The district manager is coming into town next week and he could authorize this for you
 I will call him, Kevin, and see if he'll allow me to have an appointment with him to discuss your situation
" I felt I had a chance now, but it didn't matter, because even if that didn't work out, I would find a way no matter what
 I was that determined, and I had complete confidence that I would be attending
 Tom later called me and informed me that the district manager had invited me to have lunch with him
 I accepted his invitation nervously
 During that lunch appointment Mr
 Biggens, the district manager, asked me several quite personal questions, and I answered them all very respectfully
 I understood that he was checking me out to see if I was worthy of this expensive level of financial aid
 I also told him that my ultimate dream was to own and manage my own prosthetics company
 Finally he asked me the big question I was anticipating: "Kevin, why do you want this opportunity so much?" He caught me with a mouth full of great-tasting salad
 After choking a bit, I answered his question
 "I feel, sir, that I have a lot to offer amputees since, as an amputee, I could easily demonstrate to my patients how well they could be walking
 In this way I would give them hope for a better immediate future
 I feel that I have a unique understanding as to how I could help them get back to a normal lifestyle by providing them with properly designed limbs
 Seeing my patients happily walking on a limb that I had made for them would always cause me to feel very satisfied inside
" I added, "And this would be very rewarding for me all through my life as a certified prosthetist
" Mr
 Biggens grew quiet and I grew nervous
 I prayed he would say yes as he chewed on his huge roast beef sandwich
 My emotions made me feel like a Mexican jumping bean: I just couldn't sit still! After a thoughtful delay and a sip of his Coke, he said in his deep voice with a tough-sounding southern accent, "I am sending you to the Northwestern program in Chicago because I like very much your   honest and sincere determination to be successful in the career you have chosen for yourself
 I know you will successfully complete the prosthetics program, and I am doing this because I want Vocational Rehab to be a part of your success
" Wow--my prayers had just been answered! He then quickly reminded me, "We will only be paying for the tuition, Kevin
 The rest of the expenses will be completely your responsibility
" After I told my father this fantastic news, he took out a loan on some insurance policies he had to cover my food, books, transportation, and lodging expenses
 Before I could get my thanks out of my mouth, Dad said in a very strict tone, "Kevin, you will have to repay this loan
" The loan was for about seven hundred and fifty dollars, the total estimated extra expenses
 I accepted my father's terms happily, although I understood that he really needed me to pay it back as soon as possible
 I felt a bit of pressure because of this
 Now for the first time I realized I was actually going to Chicago
 I was being given a chance to bring my dream to reality
 Soon I would be able to sit for the certification exam
 Even my ultimate goal of having my own prosthetics manufacturing facility was finally coming within my reach
   Kevin's awesome  Corvette Stingray convertible    I needed to leave my beautiful  Corvette behind as I set off for Chicago
 Reluctantly, I put it back up on blocks
 My brother Eric was charged with starting it up once a week and letting that outrageous engine run for about ten minutes or so
 Although he agreed to do so a little too eagerly for my comfort, I knew that since he was five years younger than me, I could threaten him just enough to ensure that he would do as I asked without trying to take the car for a joyride, so to speak, in my absence
 My brother also promised to look after my little black-and-white shorthaired dog, Harlequin
 She was the cute offspring of the two dogs, Peanuts and Shaina, my parents had for us
 Harlequin was a good dog, and smart
 I knew I would miss her while I was gone and she would miss me
 Finally, my trunk was packed with all that I needed for a six-month sojourn to the Windy City and I was off to the airport
 Snow was falling lightly when I arrived in Chicago
 It was a treat for me to see all the white stuff because I had not seen snow since we had moved from Cleveland when I was ten
 I didn't count the rare snow flurries that infrequently swirled around El Paso's streets
 I caught a bus and asked to be dropped at the downtown YMCA
 The driver watched impassively as I struggled to get my overloaded   trunk onto the bus
 He motioned for me to leave the trunk on the side and not try to maneuver it down the aisle
 I took a seat and watched the city go by as the bus meandered all over town
 I was the last one left on the bus, when much to my surprise, the driver dropped me off right in front of the YMCA even though it wasn't an official bus stop
 I guess he must have felt sorry for me, lugging my trunk on a bus and staying at the Y
 I appreciated the driver's sensitivity, but I did not appreciate how I felt about it
 One day I'll come back here with much more control of my life, I thought
 I checked into the Y after paying for my first week in advance
 I was shown to a tiny room that was barely large enough to hold a bed, sink, clothes closet, and small chest of drawers
 The bathroom was down the hall
 Everything felt extremely weird! I was very uneasy about this whole YMCA experience
 I had arrived two weeks early to study anatomy in order to prepare myself for the start of the prosthetics program
 I was extremely excited about the whole experience and could not wait to get started
 It turned out to be a mistake to come so early, though
 I couldn't believe how quickly I became devastatingly lonely
 When my parents called me every couple of days, I was eager to speak to them
 A typical teenager, I couldn't believe how much I wanted and looked forward to conversations with my parents
 Loneliness was a new feeling for me
 I had never been all alone before
 I was in this huge, impressive city with millions of people, and I knew absolutely no one at all
 I felt terribly isolated
 Going out, walking around for a while, and then coming back to my little room and finding that I had no one to share my experiences of the day with was very depressing
 It wore me down
 I could not get used to it
 Having the company of another human being sounds simple and trivial, but it is a pleasure I would not do without after this experience
 I felt miserable and counted the days until school would start
 I learned something about loneliness, though
 I quickly developed a new respect for the sadness that I know many people must face every day because they have no one with whom to share their day-to-day lives
   I am absolutely an explorer, and discovering new and interesting places has always been a greatly enjoyable pastime for me
 I could not resist exploring inside this huge, high building
 I remember finding a door during one excursion I took that was near the roof
 When I went through the heavy, cold, gray metallic door, I was very surprised to find myself walking onto a small outdoor patio
 The cold January air bit me in the face as this Southern boy ventured outside
 The wind immediately chilled me to the bone, but the view I found was so spectacular, I went farther out to look all around
 The incredible view took my mind off how cold it was
 I could not believe it! Seeing building after building after building, spreading in every direction as far I could possibly see, was absolutely mesmerizing
 The colors of the multisized buildings ranged from shades of light orange to reddish orange, to red shades of brick, to every shade of gray, and they jutted into the freezing cold, light blue sky
 Buildings decorated on top with pure white plumes of exhaust billowing from the chimneys attached to the heaters created an interesting effect to watch
 They were everywhere, all around as far as I could see
 I thought to myself, How can they safely manage all the people who live and work in all these buildings? This place is so absolutely huge--how do they do it? The Y was a strange place to live
 I couldn't become accustomed to it
 Just getting into the elevator was scary, because I never knew who would be joining me for the brief ride up or down
 Extremely bizarre people lived there, and friendliness was not their thing
 Just seeing how they were dressed scared me
 Some men looked like business executives and some like wealthy tycoons
 If their clothes truly represented who they were, then why oh why were they staying at the Y? During my brief stay there before school started, two girls committed suicide by jumping out of a window together
 As I read about it the next day, I realized that I never would have known it had actually happened if I hadn't seen it in the newspaper
 It had happened during the night; I never heard a thing, although I was glad about that
 As I was flipping through the newspaper that day, I came to an interesting article describing different wills and testaments people   had left their loved ones
 I remember one really funny one that went like this: "When I die, my wife cannot inherit any part of my estate until she gets remarried
 In this way I will know that there will be at least one person on this earth that really wishes I was still alive!" Amazing, I thought
 How creative, but kind of an angry statement to write in one's last will and testament
 His wife must have been a real trip to live with! Well, I knew the kind of life I wanted to live
 I wanted to keep moving in a direction that would forever keep me on a path of peace and happiness
 My goal was to live my life in this way, and definitely to have someone to share it with me, the good times and the bad
 I ate in some truly terrible restaurants that were astonishingly busy
 I figured that their downtown locations allowed them to cater to so many people that even if each customer came in once and never came back again, it really didn't matter to them
 The constant flow of new people kept them busy enough to stay open
 Instead of seeing me as a customer I felt that the waitstaff saw me as an inconvenience
 I did not understand their attitude
 The cafeteria in the Y wasn't so bad until the cashier started looking at me in a very weird way and wanted to give me unasked-for discounts on my food
 I could not wait for school to start
 I really hoped that they might let me make a new prosthesis for myself while I was attending the program, and I was eager to study the Syme-type amputation prosthesis
 Melvin, my boss, had made my most recent replacement prosthesis because Vocational Rehabilitation agreed to pay for it
 However, my limb needed to be replaced
 When I used it, I had an unusual gait pattern
 You could see my head literally moving up and down abnormally with each step I took
 Forced to take a long step with my right leg and a very short step with my left leg, I projected the appearance of limping, because of the pain I felt directly on my amputated leg
 The probable causes were that the foot was not aligned properly; the socket fit had become too big, and was once again causing painful pressure areas inside the device
 It was also too short, and this contributed to constant hip pain and strain on my good knee
 This was actually my   third prosthesis, and I had not had much luck getting one as good as the first one I had
 The less I walked, the better I felt
 When I first received this prosthesis, it was decent enough
 It had enabled me to prove to myself and to my friends how much I could do after the amputation
 For example, one weekend my friend Tim invited me and two of his friends to drive up to Ruidoso, New Mexico, to go fishing and camping
 We drove up there from El Paso and paid a small fee to camp along a tiny creek on Indian land
 We were actually on the Apache reservation, which was in the southern part of New Mexico
 We unloaded our camping gear
 Tim, our self-proclaimed leader and chief, instructed us to move along the creek until we found a good campsite deep in the woods on this fantastic mountainside
 The extremely tall pine trees were interestingly dark green and absolutely beautiful
 They were so thick around us, the sun barely shined through on us
 The wind whistled as it moved through these giant trees
 The smell of crisp, fresh mountain air was awesome and invigorating
 We walked and walked and walked until I started getting a reminder that I was walking on an artificial limb that didn't fit so well
 It was too soon to stop
 I couldn't bear the thought of having us all stop because I was crying about my sore leg
 These were good guys and they would have taken a break for me without asking any questions, but I decided to ignore the pain and walk--and walk even faster
 I soon took the lead, still holding my fishing rod in one hand and my sleeping bag, laden with supplies, in the other
 I walked as if I were Superman, totally immune to pain
 I wanted to feel like a tough young man instead of a wimp
 I halted at a turn in the creek because it had a nice, open flat area with some big dark gray rocks to the side that would provide shelter for us if it rained as we expected it to
 I waited at this potential campsite for the others to catch up and see if they agreed that I had found an acceptable site
 Tim showed up first
 He immediately leaned up against a big rock and took a deep breath
 "Man, I thought you would never stop
 This is far enough
 Let's camp right here, man!" He smiled at me, dropped his knapsack, and put his hands on his knees
   We set up camp and proceeded to have a great time fishing, sneaking up on the local rainbow trout as they hid under the rocks at the sides of the creek
 It was so cool, sneaking up to cast a tiny silver spinner out into a small crystal clear pool in the creek
 It looked completely void of all life, and then bam! Three to five trout came out of nowhere to bite
 Catching and cooking them for our dinner that night was great fun and made for excellent eating
 We finally finished setting up our campsite after our stomachs were full
 Being up in the mountains, exhausted but enjoying the whole experience, relaxing into the night, joking around and telling stories is a memory I'll always treasure
 That day I felt fully accepted by my friends as an equal, despite my disability
 I liked that feeling very much
 I knew I could do even better with an enhanced artificial leg
 My buddies never knew about the huge blister I had developed just under my kneecap, though
 By the morning I felt a lot better, and with a fresh prosthetic sock on, I was up for another glorious day
 I even went water-skiing with this leg
 Tim and Veronica had invited me to join them on Veronica's father's boat
 Tim had helped me figure out after some experimentation how to water-ski with my prosthesis on
 Having my good foot set in the front worked best
 I really liked seeing his genuine excitement as he watched me slalom on the one ski with my artificial limb jammed in the back foot holder for the first time
 Tim literally jumped up and down in the boat with his hands up, screaming something at me with his great big smile
 I was doing quite well until the rubber part of the foot came unglued from the solid part and I lost control, tumbling into the brown ice-cold water of Caballo Lake, in New Mexico, for the last time that day
 I absolutely love water-skiing
 It was something I never thought I'd be able to do after the amputation
 I have Tim to thank for showing me how to do that, as well as Veronica and her dad
 School finally started, and the lonely two weeks of isolated living was at an end
 I was able to move in with two students who were also in the prosthetics program
 They had rented a large three-bedroom apartment north of Chicago in the Rogers Park neighborhood
 The guy they had planned to room with never made it into the school   program, and they needed a roommate
 After I had begged these two guys for a few days and had given them the opportunity to see how cool I really was, they finally consented to let me be their new roommate
 I was so glad to leave the Y
 My living conditions had just gotten a whole lot better
    I wasn't sure what to expect as I took the elevator up to the seventeenth floor of the Rehab Institute of Chicago
 The view from the top of the building was absolutely awesome
 As I entered the classroom and looked out the massive windows, I could almost see clear across Lake Michigan
 I felt like I was floating among the clouds
 The instructor quickly brought me down to earth as he proclaimed, "You better pick up all the books on this list as soon as possible, because starting tomorrow you are expected to know everything in all of them
 I can assure you that you will be tested to prove that you comprehend all you should know
" He passed out the course syllabus and reading list, and I knew that any illusions of partying while I was in Chicago were totally out of the question
 Every day was filled with endless lectures and lab work
 My favorite part of the day turned out to be lunch
 The most challenging part of the day was something called Critique
 Critique came at the end, after we actually fabricated prosthetic devices
 First each of us was assigned a professional patient
 These folks were paid volunteers who allowed us to provide them with prosthetic devices that we made for them
 I have no idea where the program found our professional patients, but their presence was invaluable to us
 They had all forms   of amputations and were both men and women
 Some had a leg off below the knee or above the knee, and some had both limbs off in all different combinations
 We had arm patients with many levels of arm amputation
 We had a patient with just the hand missing, another missing an arm just below the elbow, one with an entire arm gone, and even one with both hands missing
 They were all great patients who were essential to our educational process, and we appreciated having them all
 I thought they were very courageous to let us basically experiment on them
 During Critique you had to present your patient in front of the entire class and educational staff, demonstrating how the device you had just made for him or her worked and how well it performed its intended functions
 I always wanted to be the best in the class and felt tremendous pressure to succeed
 It is necessary to understand that creating a proper prosthetic device is a very complicated endeavor
 Although I had had previous on-the-job experience that was helping me greatly, being questioned and graded for your performance at Critique was always very intense
 During Critique, you had to exhibit that you had a complete understanding of all the biomechanics involved, as well as all the anatomy and gait analysis techniques
 You were expected to be able to explain thoroughly why you had constructed the type of device you had
 This was the theory part of our education and was very challenging as well
 I just loved lunch
 As the morning progressed, I would develop such a hunger that I would feel more and more uncomfortable as lunchtime approached
 After finally eating my simple lunch I would feel so good that I would kind of zone out on the wonderful, satisfied feeling I was experiencing
 I would lean back in the booth and close my eyes
 I would then deeply relax, using the feeling in my stomach as a platform for a peaceful escape from the soul--crushing stress of Critique
 My fellow students called me the Texan for the obvious reason that I came from Texas
 As we were all getting to know each other, a simple math problem helped me impress my classmates
 One day during the first week of prosthetics school, I was relaxing with my   head on my arms on the chair desktop surface
 I was just waiting for the professor to show up for the early morning lecture
 One of my roommates was trying to calculate the costs involved in our rental agreement when he shouted from across the room, "Kevin, what's two hundred and fifty-one divided by three?" Without any hesitation, I replied, "Eighty-three point six, six, six, six, six, six
" That simple repeating decimal was an easy calculation for me
 The other students who had heard our conversation were very impressed with my lightning-quick ability to calculate all those sixes
 As the program progressed, my serious devotion to the profession was what earned me true respect from my fellow students
 Although I quickly settled into the routine of the program, I was still quite nervous about the daily quizzes and questions provided by our instructors
 However, I enjoyed the prosthetics program very much
 Todd, one of my fellow students, would always check out the new professional patients waiting for us before we started experimenting on them
 He would then let us know which one would prove to be the greatest challenge
 The patients continued to change as we learned about the different types of prosthetic devices required for different types of amputations
 It was an honor to have the most challenging cases assigned to you, because that meant the professors thought your positive past performances were worthy of a greater challenge
 Often, I was given the most difficult cases
 My professors held me in high regard and seemed very interested in ensuring that I received the best possible education they could provide
 The lab part of school was easy for me because I had had three years of on-the-job training before starting the program
 Most of the students in the program, like my two roommates, Terry and Robert, were academically well versed but had little or no lab experience
 I would finish my lab work quickly and get home by midafternoon, so I had plenty of time to study the theories, biomechanics, and anatomy that were necessary to learn
 My roommates would roll into the apartment as late as eight o'clock some nights, exhausted after finishing their lab work or fabrication
 They looked like hell, their clothes covered in ground plastic dust, the plastic smell clinging to them
   One day as we strolled back into the lecture room after lunch, we saw Todd walking up to us briskly
 He was very upset and nervous as he told us that we were about to get our above-the-elbow amputation patients
 I couldn't understand why he was so upset, since we had known about this before lunch
 "One of the patients has no face!" he stammered, explaining that the patient was a burn victim
 The three of us looked at one another, shocked and nervous
 "The guy looks really bad," Todd muttered
 "Go and find out his name so we can see who is getting him," I countered
 Up high on the center back wall of the lab was a big chalkboard where the names of the students and their corresponding patients were posted
 No one wanted to be the one to have to work with the burn victim
 Todd was soon running back to where we were all frozen in place
 The burn victim had a name now, Samson
 Slowly we went into the lab, wondering who would have to deal with Samson
 I raised my eyes to look at the board, and my heart sank
 My name was written next to his
 Panic flowed over me with a rush of adrenaline, almost like an immersion into a liquid pool of electricity
 Like a condemned man, I walked slowly to my workbench and started gathering my measuring devices and measurement forms as I nervously organized myself
 Some of the other students were not very helpful
 Unwanted, unnecessary comments filled the room as they worked off their relief at not having to face Samson
 "Hey, Texan, enjoy your date," and "Wow, dude, I'm glad I'm not you" are examples of the comments I received
 I could see that most of the students were appropriately focused on what lay ahead for them and couldn't care less about my impending situation
 I pulled myself together and robotically entered the patient area
 I went through the motions I needed to accomplish the goal for that day
 I had to take a cast and measurements for an above-elbow prosthetic device
 I think this was a defining moment in my professional development
 I had to face my fears about dealing with severely deformed individuals and get over this unprofessional distraction: fear
 Samson's face was a mass of scar tissue
 His nose was just two little holes in the middle of what had once been a face
 His eyes were   devoid of expression
 No trace of emotion could be detected through the mask of scar tissue
 He had no lips to frame his distorted mouth opening
 I was truly scared of this guy and a total nervous wreck
 His chest and his left side where his arm had been amputated above the elbow were completely scarred
 Even his armpit was marked by the fire that had maimed him
 I began to realize that my professors had actually given me a gift, since this was an extremely difficult case to fit successfully with a comfortable prosthesis of any type
 I would also have to learn how to look at the patient and talk to him in a respectful, professional manner
 As I worked at preparing Samson's artificial limb, his deep-seated anger became apparent, and I definitely experienced it firsthand one morning
 While testing the function of the prosthetic arm, I politely asked him to continue by slowly extending the prosthetic elbow straight out without opening the stainless steel hook on the end of the forearm section
 He just looked at me and did nothing
 I repeated exactly what I had just said
 After a considerable delay, he abruptly extended it, almost hitting me in the nose with the hook
 It missed me by only a hair
 Eventually we all got used to his appearance as we saw him daily for about a week until we finished creating our devices
 We even began to enjoy riding with him in the elevator to the cafeteria for lunch
 We would watch people's faces as the elevator door opened on each floor
 People who saw him for the first time reacted differently
 We didn't know what expression we would see on their faces as the elevator stopped and the door opened, again and again, on the long journey from the seventeenth to the second floor
 We found their reactions most interesting and educational
 Some people turned away quickly in shock; some people looked horrified and kept staring at him; some just looked at him with very sad eyes that almost formed tears
 I made him an acceptable arm
 My classmates discussed my work in Critique class and agreed the device was acceptable
 I did very well throughout the upper-extremity classes as well as the lower-extremity ones
 I was extremely proud that I excelled in the "special prosthetics" courses
 These were very complex cases that   required developing prosthetics to replace entire limbs such as an entire thighbone--and in rare cases even half the pelvic bone
 More important, I felt very good about the fact that I was growing as a young man, conquering my fears and starting well on the difficult road to becoming a true professional
 I felt good knowing that I would soon be called a certified prosthetist, having earned the right to put C
P
 after my name
 One afternoon while we were working on making a complicated below-the-knee prosthesis, I learned a valuable lesson beyond the mechanics of fashioning artificial limbs
 The device we were working on that day consisted of a leather thigh corset attached to external knee joints
 We had to position the lower half of the joints carefully on the prosthetic socket in just the right place
 It was very time consuming and stressful to create this type of complicated device properly
 I saw one student, Samuel, have his corset with the joints already attached get ripped out of his hands as it flew into the high-powered sanding machine
 It went around and around several times before throwing one joint and then the other up into the air
 When he finally turned off the machine, his damaged corset just fell to the floor as a jumbled scratched-up mess
 I felt bad for him but had to press on, as I had my own problems doing my work well
 I was consoling my fellow student while still working on my corset
 Professor Gibson, a thin, older European man, walked over and started lecturing us
 He went on about how as prosthetists we would be the difference between pain and comfort for our patients as we provided them with finished prosthetic devices
 I was outraged to think that this man who still had all his limbs could truly understand what an amputee actually feels
 "How would you know anything about what pain an amputee feels? You're not an amputee," I proclaimed loudly
 Professor Gibson grabbed my arm and pulled me into an adjacent empty room
 He gently maneuvered me up against a wall by my shoulders
 The whole time he kept saying over and over again in a most serious voice, "I know what it feels like, I know, I know
" His face was now an inch away from mine as our slow motion terminated against the wall
 His angry eyes blazed directly into me, convincing me of his deep sincerity
   I realized in that moment that I was just a hotshot young student with a big mouth, and totally out of line
 Professor Gibson taught me in his, shall I say, somewhat direct manner that someone could be a sincere, excellent prosthetist without being an amputee
 I had a newfound respect for the true professionals out there working in the field of prosthetics with all their limbs intact
 I completed the device I was making and passed the Critique
 I finally had the opportunity to make a new prosthesis for myself
 My friends helped me with the alignment of the foot and I did all the fabrication
 It was a good prosthesis, and I was proud that I had fashioned it
 I walked very well on it to prove the point
 It was the most comfortable device I had ever used
 I also finally finished my term paper, which was titled "The Physiological Adjustment to a Prosthesis
" I had chosen that topic because I wanted to learn more about myself and discover what I could about my own physiological adjustment
 I'll tell you, I had my own problems, because I continued to feel pretty pissed off from time to time about the fact that I was an amputee
 I was especially annoyed when I saw how some things that had come easily to me no longer did--simple things like dancing, for example, that needed some finesse
 I was totally lacking the finesse necessary to perform a task like dancing well
 I could still dance, but not as well as my friends could
 It hurt me deeply to see them bouncing and twirling effortlessly with the girls, who obviously enjoyed dancing with them
 The prosthesis was definitely not a real foot and ankle
 It could never offer the control necessary to perform tasks that really needed precision and elegance
 Hell, I could not even walk in a visually perfect, normal way
 The fact that I was a perfectionist was not helping either
 I had no desire to swim on a regular basis anymore, or even to wear shorts on the hottest days
 This reality disturbed me and was a definite part of my struggle to fully accept the amputation of my foot and the use of my prosthetic device
 The program came to an end, and I successfully completed all that was asked of me as a prosthetics student
 I even passed the test to become a provider of services for the Veterans Administration and   felt exceedingly happy and proud about that
 I was experiencing an excellent feeling of completion
 Unfortunately, I had miscalculated my finances and had to borrow ten dollars from Daniel, a nice kid from Wisconsin I liked very much who completed the prosthetics program with me
 Daniel ordered, "Garrison, damn it, you better pay me back!" Daniel was very husky and tall and therefore a bit intimidating, so promising to pay him back was a serious business proposition for me
 I eventually convinced him I was good for the money, so he begrudgingly agreed to lend it to me, and I thanked him most sincerely
 I now had just enough money for transportation to the airport so I could fly back to my home in El Paso
 Even though the summer months were much more comfortable here, I was eager to get home
   Kevin relaxing with a furry friend    Soon after I returned home, I reported to the Vocational Rehabilitation office in downtown El Paso
 Everyone in the office stood up and applauded as I entered
 They were proud that I had successfully completed the program and was ready to be a productive member of society
 I hadn't realized that many of the people the program tries to help never complete the courses they start
 That makes the organization look bad--almost as if they are wasting the federal funds meant to help educate the local disabled population
 I personally feel that this organization is very beneficial, because the government actually gets back all the money they spend on you
 After you start working, you begin paying income taxes and the government gets its money back over time
 The government is investing in people, and you don't have to think of it as charity
 My counselor, Tom, insisted that I sit down and write a letter to the Texas governor's office
 He wanted me to tell the governor how important the Vocational Rehabilitation program was to me and should always be to the state and federal government
 I wrote everything he wanted me to write and happily finished the letter
 Tom was delighted with me, especially because he could consider my   case successfully closed
 It was very nice to see how important that was to him
 I'm sure he was feeling a nice sense of completion too
 My car was running great, and I was ready to collect all my things and set out for new horizons
 El Paso offered me very little
 My previous boss, Melvin, said I could have my old job back, but I would be doing the exact same things I had been doing before prosthetics school
 I understood that was all he could offer me, so I wasn't upset with him--or interested in his job offer
 When I worked for him, I had asked Melvin if I could call various manufacturers to find out about the latest improvements or products, but I was told, "No, not at this time
" The prosthetics manufacturers often offered educational courses to explain how to properly use the latest improvements in their components
 To my great disappointment, I was never allowed to attend one of these courses
 I had felt somewhat cheated, or held back, which also contributed to my need to move on
 If I now returned to Melvin's shop under those conditions, I would not be able to continue growing as a professional
 I needed more consistent patient contact experience as well as an opportunity to keep current with the constant technological improvements and changes
 I graciously declined Melvin's offer to stay
 I left on good terms with him, thanking him sincerely for all he had taught me
 I thanked him for all the excellent guidance and help he had freely offered, re-creating my car, making it better than it was when I bought it
 I needed to bring my dreams into reality, and it obviously wasn't going to happen here
 I'll never forget what Melvin used to say when he was trying to teach me something: "I am only going to tell you this once, so you better listen
" Another favorite expression of his was, "I am only going to show you this once, so you better pay close attention
" I did learn a lot from my old boss Melvin
 I accepted an offer to work in Evansville, Indiana, with the opportunity to have the full patient contact experience I needed
 I still required a few more college classes to complete my prerequisites so that I could sit for the professional national exam through the American Board for Certification
 I decided to register at the local   state college, Indiana State University of Evansville, after I had settled in
 Harlequin and I drove off for Evansville with all my possessions, and that was to be my last time in El Paso for a long while
 I actually went back to visit only for my twenty-year high school reunion, which is a whole other interesting story
 The car drove beautifully, and I enjoyed the long drive with the top down most of the way
 I moved along north through the beautiful Texas landscape that seemed to keep spreading out before my tired eyes
 I could not believe the wide-open spaces of Texas land that expanded all around me for as far as I could see as I drove
 It blew me away, seeing all the rolling hills and valleys becoming greener in shades as I drove north
 The shadows of the few deep, dense white clouds floating above in the profoundly blue sky darkened the landscape only in their earthly reflection, adding an interesting contrast to my view of the landscape
 The cool wind blasting through my hair exhilarated me and was my constant companion, besides Harlequin, as I flew along the highway
 The sun seemed to turn off and on as I drove through the clouds' shadows, temporarily shining bright and reflecting light in my face as I tried to focus on the road
 As I drove, I prayed for the next part of my life to develop as I looked ahead
 I felt very good about my accomplishments to date and could not wait to get started with my new job as an interning prosthetist
 My thinking wandered
 Despite the wonderful scenery, I found myself dwelling on my social life and how it had become pretty much devoid of anything exciting
 I no longer participated in regular sporting activities, or steady girlfriend development
 I felt a kind of void in my overall sense of well-being
 I experienced emptiness where there used to be a fulfilled feeling of accomplishment in these areas
 My career took most of my time and attention, I rationalized; this was the reason for my lack of motivation in these areas
 I didn't know it then, but I was rationalizing wrong! Suddenly I realized that it was pitch black and I was in the middle of nowhere, totally exposed with the convertible's top down
 The night noises sounded quite strange, and this made me decide to pull over and put the top up
 Who knew what kind of night-flying   animals lurked out here in the wide-open Texas wilderness, I thought
 I slowed, pulled off the highway in the middle of nowhere, stopped, jumped out and hurriedly pulled the top up, locked it down, jumped back in, closed the door, and rolled up the windows faster than an electric window could travel up
 I then sped off
 I continued on to my overnight-stay destination definitely feeling safer, even though the convertible top did not really offer much protection
 Finally arriving in Evansville, I stayed in a motel that offered daily and weekly room rentals
 I was going to start my new job the next morning
 That night, as I lay in bed, I thought about how far I had come with the development of my prosthetics education up to this point
 Even so, moving to this strange place was giving me a tremendous amount of anxiety
 Maybe I should have felt a bit off balance and unsure about what I wanted to do with my life, but I felt confident in my decisions, even though there were more things I wanted to accomplish
 I felt that I knew what would be expected of me by my patients, and of course, my new boss, and this helped
 I knew I could be a great prosthetist and that I truly enjoyed the profession
 I felt solid, with two good supportive legs firmly on the ground under me
 I was ready to learn all I could about my profession, a profession of my choosing, a great profession that offered a renewed life of functional possibilities for amputees
 I was ready for the next step in my evolution as an up-and-coming young prosthetist
 I planned on being very respectful to my new boss, hoping he would like me immensely as he learned more about me while we worked together
 I hoped that he might be motivated to help me to learn all I needed to know
 I wanted so much to accomplish my goal of becoming a certified prosthetist and making superior limbs for people in need
 My ultimate goal, that I was just starting to dream of quite seriously, was to one day, dared I think, actually have my very own prosthetics facility
 All of the excitement made sleep elusive that night
 With my career path firmly established, I reevaluated my complete life's dreams
 I thought about marriage and family
 I was sure that one   day I would somehow find and get married to a beautiful, wonderful woman, a sexy angel with long hair
 We would meet one day in the future and I would love her eternally
 I decided that my dream girl would have to work in the health care field so that we could share our workday experiences
 In this way we could have a full understanding of each other's workday as we enjoyed our lives together
 I wanted a woman who cared about our health completely and lovingly and consistently cooked healthful meals for our family
 I felt that if I ate properly, meaning never eating anything in excess, I might possibly lessen my risk of getting that damn cancer ever again
 I wanted to have at least four children so there would not be one child in the middle like I was, because it was downright brutal at times growing up with my two brothers
 I also felt that if something ever happened to their mother or me, they would always have each other to share their lives with and support each other
 I desperately wanted it to be possible for us to travel around the world with the children
 I wanted to expose them to the great invaluable educational opportunities that I knew had to come with world travel experiences
 Of course, I wanted to have a great sports car to drive every day of the week and an ultra-huge quadraphonic stereo system
 I had a lot to learn as a professional, and I knew that bigger paychecks would come (which is something else I wanted very much) in time as my skills continued to develop
 I just needed to be patient and learn all I could
 Sleep finally enveloped me, and I began the recharging process that deep, restful sleep brings
 I first met my new boss, Cooter Smith, shortly after stepping into the office's front entrance
 Passing through the big glass door, I focused my eyes on him as he sat behind the little receptionist desk smoking a cigarette in the room's center
 He looked up and immediately began to smile, standing up to greet me, moving around from behind the desk, not knowing what to do with his cigarette, extending his free hand for a good solid handshake
 As we shook hands, I looked him directly in the eyes and he looked back without ever losing that great friendly smile as he nodded   in welcome
 "Well, come on in, Kevin, and have a sit-down with me," he said in his country voice
 We proceeded to have our first long conversation; I instantly sensed that I had made an excellent decision to take this job
 I felt okay about having this man, Cooter Smith, as my new boss and mentor
 Cooter had a very short below-knee amputation
 He walked with a terrible limp mostly for this reason
 He had received his amputation because of a motorcycle accident many years earlier
 Cooter was really something, because he continued to drive a motorcycle, actually back and forth to work every day
 I had him show me how he did it--how he rode--and when I saw him easily mount that big metallic red bike and casually take off on it, I was immediately impressed
 He had obviously gotten over any residual fears he may have had about motorcycles
 He flew! A big corporation that owned many prosthetics facilities across the country owned this facility also
 Smith was the manager for this location
 Cooter eventually asked where I was staying, and when he heard that I had no place rented long term yet, he recommended that I speak to the owner of the building that the facility was in
 It turned out that there was a furnished apartment upstairs that was available for rent
 I immediately made an appointment with the landlord to see about getting that apartment
 It turned out to be a great deal
 Since I agreed to paint the place and put up some wallpaper, I would be charged only twenty-five dollars a month
 We had a deal with a handshake, and I was thrilled that there would be no driving back and forth to work, just running up and down the stairs
 The low rent would also make it possible for me to pay my dad back the money I owed him much sooner
 This all made me very happy
    I learned a lot working with Cooter, especially about upper-extremity prosthetics, because I was now living in the Corn Belt with a lot of hardworking farmers around
 Unfortunately, farm-related injuries were abundant
 These were very challenging cases mostly involving arms because of the nature of the dangerous equipment the farmers had to use daily
 I remember one nice man, Sam McDermate, who had been electrocuted while working on his farm
 He had lost both his feet, one arm just below the elbow, and one eye as a direct result of the electrocution
 Sam was the toughest man I had ever met at this point in my life--a big muscular man
 He came in one day needing repairs to his right prosthetic arm
 Sam had been installing fence posts and had broken a control cable on his short below-elbow-amputationtype arm
 Sam managed his own farm and took care of his family, consisting of a wife and two small children
 We simply repaired the broken cable and had a very nice visit with a satisfied patient
 One of my first lower-extremity patients turned out to be a very nervous man who had a below-the-knee amputation on the right side
 Roland was his name
 My boss thought he would be another good patient for me to take care of
 By then I had taken   care of a couple of patients and Cooter had gained some confidence in me
 He started giving me the opportunity to learn how to fit amputees with prosthetics through direct patient contact and very little guidance from him on purpose
 It was exactly the learning experience I had hoped for
 When this patient came back to test the fit and then the foot alignment, I found quite quickly that I had messed up
 I slipped Roland's leg onto him, but when he stood up on it, he literally started jumping up and down frantically
 He was trying to force his short remaining limb into the custom-made prosthetic socket I had created for him
 The whole time he was jumping, he was saying over and over, "This is the worst leg I have ever had
" I finally got him to sit back down and asked him to take the leg off
 I wanted to go back into the lab and figure out what needed to be done to correct the fit
 As I was leaving the room, he said, "You should toss it in the garbage because it's crap
" After much examination I discovered that I had put my other patient's left below-knee socket onto his right foot
 I couldn't tell just by looking at the sockets
 An experienced prosthetist could easily have seen the difference between a right below-knee socket and a left one
 I quickly switched the sockets
 When I had Mr
 Fuming--Roland--try the fit again, he said, "That's more like it, yes!" I learned a lot that day, but the stress of the experience had me completely exhausted
 I was ready to go upstairs and just crash out
 I did end up going to bed early that night
 While I lay in bed--a mattress on the floor--thinking about the day and evaluating how I had performed, I realized that to make this job less stressful, I needed to learn how to create these very complicated devices properly
 It would be good for the patients, of course, and good for me emotionally
 I knew if I did my best and constantly worked to improve myself, I'd be able to sleep at night with a clear conscience, knowing I had done my finest work and that my patients were happy
 If I could do this, I knew I would always earn and deserve my patients' trust in me, and that was the most important thing
 I learned that if my patients did not fully trust me, my experience with them would be most difficult and probably lead to failure on my part
   I found out about one of the worst mistakes I had made when one of my above-the-knee patients, Mr
 Truckner, came back in one day with this terrible story
 He walked in using his old prosthesis, carrying the one I had made for him in a bag
 He complained directly to Cooter, although loudly enough on purpose for me to hear him quite clearly as he saw me working in an adjacent room
 He went on to tell my boss in his unusual deep voice, "Cooter, I was doing my shopping, walking all around in Grand Grocery, when as I was pushing my cart down the wide aisle in the pet food section, I suddenly felt my foot loosen with a twist and then click off
 The foot then actually shot out into the middle of the aisle as I fell against my cart
 A lady in front of me, who was carrying an arm full of cans of dog food, saw what happened, my foot rolling way out into the middle of the aisle
 She directly dropped all the dog food cans and nearly blacked out, shaking
 She started grabbing at her heart as she watched this unbelievable sight
" I came out from the lab area and repeatedly apologized to our patient
 "Mr
 Truckner, I am so sorry for your terrible experience at the grocery store! Thank God you're all right and didn't get hurt
 I must have not tightened the parts together properly
 I am so sorry, sir!" I was eventually absolved of my errors since I was still interning
 I was given an opportunity to learn from this most serious mistake and reassemble his leg properly
 Mr
 Truckner was a cool guy--I liked him
 I appreciated his genuine forgiveness for this most serious incident
 It was expected that I would make mistakes, but it was important that I learn from them
 The new type of connection design for modular component parts that was in Mr
 Truckner's above-knee prosthesis had four sides
 There is an Allen screw on each side that holds his leg together at various opposing points
 This part of the connection with the Allen screws is called the female side, as the male side has a four-sided block of metal that fits exactly inside the female side
 As you tighten each Allen screw in each side independently, it locks down very well because the metal block has a slight pyramid taper to it that forces both pieces together nicely
 In some above-knee-type prosthetic devices there are four of these   male and female connectors
 One attachment is below the socket, one above the prosthetic knee (the thigh section), one below the knee, and one above the foot and ankle (the shin section)
 There is an aluminum pylon or pipe sandwiched in between all of them, thus completing the thigh and shin sections
 With all of these connectors you could then adjust the alignment of the leg in twenty different directions, not counting the actual knee motion control adjustments
 Below-the-knee limbs in most cases have only twelve separate adjustments because there are only two alienable connectors being used
 It's complicated! I had just learned, to Mr
 Truckner's misfortune, that if you tighten the Allen screws without putting forth careful attention, you could cause the attachment to wedge together improperly, simulating a properly tightened attachment
 All it took was time until the parts would jump back into their proper-fitting positions with respect to each other
 The attachment would then loosen and continue loosening with the aid of the vibration caused naturally with each step thereafter
 I had also been learning quite slowly about alignment in general
 The final position of the prosthetic knee joint alignment as well as the foot in the finished prosthesis always had to be located in the most correct position possible
 No matter how advanced the prosthetic parts may be, if they are not aligned correctly under the patient's body, the patient will never be able to benefit from them as he or she should
 This would continue to happen no matter how hard he or she might try to walk properly
 I realized that I had to learn proper alignment, since next to the actual socket fit it was the most important part of making efficient, properly working prosthetic devices
 It ended up taking me about three years to master this part of the limb-making process
 I attended Indiana State University in Evansville nightly until I finally successfully completed my educational requirements
 I took a wonderful art class during this time as an elective and enjoyed it most of all
 This course enabled me to get back into using my artistic creativity outside of prosthetics
   I started sketching in a medium that was new for me, using various-size ink pen quills after dipping them into black liquid india ink
 I can still smell that ink today, with its distinctive dry, dull, musty smell
 This type of drawing took incredible control to master, and I greatly enjoyed the challenge of it
 Too much ink on the quill could drip
 Moving across the paper quickly could cause a blank skip or too slowly could cause an unwanted blotch
 Pushing down too hard could scratch the paper or even tear it
 Many years later I found an incredibly detailed, large india ink drawing that I had created
 I remembered that this drawing took me more than a year to complete
 I worked on it when I felt like it, stopping when I became tired
 I had finally finished it in 
 While studying it, in retrospect, I could see that this artwork clearly showed the state of mind I was in at this time in my life
 I was obviously still feeling trapped, confused, and concerned about my future
 I was mentally stagnant, still in a limbo state of mind
 I had even appropriately named the work: Search for Reality
 The ladies on that huge campus were so beautiful that I couldn't believe my eyes
 Unfortunately, I never had good relationships develop, much to my dismay
 My shyness just continued to dominate me
   Search for Reality (actual size: " × ")   I received my invitation to sit for the prosthetics board's exam in  when I had finally met the full educational requirements
 Reality struck and I instantly became a nervous wreck
 I was freaking out about this examination, which was all that stood between the completion of my professional career education and me
 I read that the exam, which was scheduled to take place in Chicago, spanned two days
 It included a practical exam one day and an oral exam the second day
 I had already taken and passed the written exam while I had been in prosthetics school, and that had entitled me to take the other two exams
 Once those exams were successfully completed, I would become a certified prosthetist, or C
P
, and that had always been my goal
 I will never forget opening the letter the exam board sent after I sat for the boards
 I had waited months to learn whether or not I had passed
 That day I saw Cooter walking over to me with a great big smile, carrying a letter
 He looked extremely happy as he handed me the letter, and I was confused about why he was smiling so much
 The letter was addressed to me, of course, but there were those two little letters, C
P
, after my name
 I was thrilled to see , C
P
" in print for the first time, meaning I had passed the test
 It was great having Cooter hand me the letter after he sorted through the mail that morning
 He presented it to me with his own profound personal joy for my accomplishment
 He knew how important it was to me
 I really liked Cooter, my boss, very much because he offered me such an excellent opportunity, allowing me to learn under his supervision
 Apparently, Cooter thought I was management material, and without me knowing it, he had told this to his boss, Mr
 Curray
 The next thing I knew, upper management wanted me to transfer to their Chicago office to be groomed to assume the management of that office someday in the future
 I accepted the offer with guarded optimism, though, and began planning my departure from Evansville, coordinating with Cooter and my landlord
 Leaving Evansville was very difficult for me and I think   Cooter also, but I needed to move on, and Cooter knew that most of all
 I was returning to Chicago, only this time I knew people who lived there
 I was somewhat familiar with the big city now and I was a certified prosthetist, a professional, ready to continue the development of my prosthetics career with enthusiasm
 When I arrived in Chicago, I smiled as I realized what a long way I had come since my first visit
 It felt especially nice driving into the Windy City and not having some nice bus driver take pity on me and drop me off on a downtown street corner
 I was arriving in style this time! I cruised into the city in my hot convertible Corvette Stingray, with its rhythmic rumbling sound, as I traveled up the Outer Drive
 I glanced to my left as I saw most of the tall Rehab Institute building in the distance where I had attended my Northwestern University prosthetics program
 I was so happy to see it
 It had become my symbol, for my professional career foundation
 I was back!   ROBERT H

 I take pleasure in recommending your artificial limbs, especially for their durability
 My leg is amputated six inches below the knee joint
 I have worn one of your limbs since 
 I am employed as a signalman, and attend to my duties without the least trouble

 Below knee
 I was a professional tightrope walker and aeronaut before I lost my leg, and I did not propose to allow the loss of a leg to compel me to seek another occupation
 I can walk a tightrope nearly as well as ever I could
 Note--The above illustration has been made from an instantaneous photograph taken of Professor Jacoby while performing on a tightrope
 He is balancing entirely on his artificial leg; his natural foot is off the rope in the act of passing forward to take the next step
 Illustration ()    The position in the Chicago office turned out to be perfect for me
 They really needed additional help since a staff practitioner had just left
 The opening was for a practitioner who had prosthetic patient care experience
 I was ready for it, and upper management agreed
 There were two good reasons why I accepted the new job
 First, I would be exposed to many different types of prosthetic cases and would be able to expand my skills
 Second, they offered more compensation
 I really appreciated the moderate salary increase
 I had learned a lot working in the Evansville branch office for almost two years, especially about upper-extremity cases
 The manager, Mr
 Burk, gave me all the cases that came in, except the patients who still wanted to wear wooden legs
 I had no experience with that type of old-style limb and could not believe how many amputees still preferred that type of prosthetic device
 There were two main reasons why doctors in the Chicago area were still prescribing the old-fashioned type of limbs
 First, patients insisted on that type of limb because they were used to it and trusted its comfort level and performance
 Second, the thickness of the wood allowed the socket, the part of the artificial limb that   the patient fits their remaining limb into, to be made bigger if the patient gained weight
 The boss took those cases, and the technician, Armand, helped him immensely, as they both had woodworking experience of that nature
 They actually provided all types of prosthetic wood fabrication
 The time involved was considerable because this style of limb production, including the fitting and finishing process, took considerable more time to complete
 I very much enjoyed watching them create the limbs from scratch and learned a lot about basic limb fabrication
 It was like traveling back to the turn of the century, when these types of limbs had been thought to be the highest of technical quality and achievement
 Armand fashioned a wooden foot with an articulating ankle joint that sat on leather bushings inside the freshly hand-carved wooden foot pieces
 The toe bent with an insert of rubber that allowed a simulated toe-flexing motion
 These devices functioned as well as the modern devices made with plastic (polyester resin) reinforced with fiberglass instead of wood
 The way these limbs performed was also impressive as the gait patterns were also similar to the limbs we were making in the late s
 One day, Mrs
 Serena, an elderly woman, came into the Chicago office with her son
 I started making her what I thought would be a perfect artificial limb
 After about sixteen hours of labor, going step by step over a few days as I had been taught, the leg was ready
 Mrs
 Serena returned for the dynamic alignment and then completion of the prosthesis
 During the fitting she consistently complained in her soft voice, "Mr
 Garrison, I have pressure here, and it's very painful
" She pointed to a place on her amputated limb that seemed to cause the pain
 I spent hours trying to relieve the pressure spot she referred to by grinding plastic away from the troublesome area
 I sanded the inside of the socket that mirrored that spot smooth, confident I had eased the imperfection, only to have her repeatedly tell me, "It hurts, it hurts, it still hurts
" Sweat literally dripped down my pale face as I concentrated with immense intensity, desperately trying to find the mysterious area   that was causing her such discomfort
 I was at my wits' end and did not know what to do
 Mrs
 Serena's son was getting tired of waiting, and his impatience was obvious as he paced the room
 I could not find the spot and felt like I was beginning to ruin the socket's overall fit with the continual grinding and smoothing
 I didn't want to ruin the rest of the fit and make the situation worse
 I had to think, use logic, and figure this out
 I thought it was obvious by then that the area she indicated was not where the cause of the problem existed; otherwise she would have said it felt better by that point
 If only I could find the spot on her myself, mark it on her somehow, and transfer it to the inner socket of the artificial leg, I would be able to quickly solve the problem
 "Mrs
 Serena," I asked, "could I please push in different spots on your remaining limb to help me find that painful area that you are feeling when you stand on the leg? She immediately said, "That will be fine, son
 Go ahead if that will help
" Mrs
 Serena emitted a definite grimace when I found the exact sore spot
 Once I had found it, I discovered that it was in a completely different location from where she had been pointing
 Now I had to mark it in a way that would transfer to the inside of the socket for an exact reference
 The secretary in the front office looked at me strangely when I asked to borrow her lipstick for a minute
 After dabbing some lipstick off on a paper towel, I used it to mark Mrs
 Serena's amputated limb directly on the pressure spot I had found
 I asked poor, tired Mrs
 Serena to step into the limb for a few more painful seconds without her prosthetic sock on
 I hoped this would be the last time I would see her contorted facial expression of pain as she put pressure on her limb, standing
 I slipped the limb off
 I apologized to her, saying, "Mrs
 Serena, please forgive me for putting you through this
 Artificial limbs can be quite troublesome at times
" She gave me a weak smile in return for my sincere apology
 I finally had an exact mark of the pressure spot in the socket and took off for the grinding machine
 I relieved the lipstick-marked area by sanding just that region until I created a pressure-relief spot
   I scurried back, smiling, and put the limb on her
 Lo and behold, there was no more pain
 I had a successful fit, thank God
 It was quite a learning experience and from then on, lipstick was one of my most useful diagnostic tools
 When I brought the lipstick back to Mary, our secretary, she began to wave her hands frantically, shooing me away
 The whole time she was saying, "Keep it, Kevin, just keep it!" She had this extremely disturbed look on her face
 "Wow," I said
 "Thanks, Mary--you're too kind
" I now had my own new very useful tool, assisting me in my work, helping me perfect the socket fit! Electronic limbs for the arms had just been invented
 They initially were developed in the late s, and were improving in design all the time
 I had some great experiences providing these very cool upper-extremity devices
 Chicago was highly industrialized, and that led to approximately  percent of the practice being concentrated on upper-extremity cases
 I learned a lot about arms while working in Chicago, providing many while I worked there
 Arms are somewhat easier to create than legs, mainly because you don't walk on your arms
 There is a lot less pressure and stress on the amputated arm tissue compared with amputated lower-limb tissue
 The legs have to support your entire body weight, and the pounds per square inch can really add up and cause some stress
 In their own way, arms are also complicated to make, although the considerations are mostly focused on alignment and control issues
 Putting the hand in the most useful position offering successful opportunities for very important activities of daily living, like eating, obviously is very important
 I often remembered my upper-extremity work experience from my first prosthetics facility in El Paso
 I assisted in the fabrication of a relatively famous man's arms
 His name was GG Armando, a private detective
 He had lost both his hands and half his forearms below the elbow while playing with blasting caps he had found near the railroad tracks where he lived
 When he had been just twelve years old, he had blown his hands and arms up while trying to have   some fun and get the caps to explode by smashing them between two rocks
 GG had a 
-caliber handgun mechanism manufactured to his specifications that he had us insert into his right prosthetic arm
 It could fire just one shot at a time
 It had a modified trigger in the form of a loop that was connected to his arm with a stainless-steel cable
 He could make it fire by tightening his biceps muscle, which was attached to the other end of this stainless steel cable
 That handgun mechanism was considered a concealed weapon and he was licensed to carry it because he was a private detective
 We were impressed, especially when he told us that he was invited to do an episode of the television series Hawaii Five-O
 The episode was called "Hook Man
" I begged him for an autographed picture taken on the set, and GG said he would take care of it for me
 I still have it to this day, a signed black-and-white glossy picture of GG posing with Jack Lord, the star of Hawaii Five-O
 The two men were pretending to be fist fighting and GG Armando signed it using one of his hooks
 I will always appreciate how he signed it: "Kevin, always be tough, this is a tough world," with the year, 
 While I was working in Chicago, my parents decided to move to Florida in April 
 My brothers and I had all moved away from El Paso, where I had lived for about fifteen years
 My grandparents Ida and Joe, who had been living in Cleveland, and my uncle Jack, who had lived in New Jersey, had already moved to Florida
 They talked my parents into moving there as well
 Growing up mostly in El Paso, I had learned to love the warm weather
 Waking up in the morning and going outside only to be greeted by warm air was something I realized I enjoyed and missed very much
 I decided to move to Florida as soon as I could secure a good job
 The cold weather of Chicago was not for me
 I started thinking of moving to Florida myself very seriously after the blizzard of  came
 My amputated limb in my plastic prosthesis would feel like it had been in a freezer after being outside in the snow for just a few minutes
 I was seriously thinking of trying to invent a heater for   it--it was that bad
 I was ready to move out of the cold country and finally did so in the summer of 
 I drove down in a different car, as I had wrecked my Corvette on Chicago's Outer Drive during a snowstorm when I had become involved in a pile-up as I drove over an ice-covered overpass
 The accident hadn't been my fault, but I was heartbroken when I saw my car get smashed as the cars kept piling up
 The Corvette was totaled, but at least I was able to sell it for parts and received about nine hundred dollars
 I had to settle for an old yellow Cutlass Supreme, because as a learning prosthetist I was still on a rather modest salary
 I most happily drove it down to sunny, warm Florida
 Because I was an amputee, I felt I had to learn to drive exceptionally well
 I was always afraid of losing my driver's license because I thought the police would think I was a hazardous driver if I was constantly involved in traffic accidents and they knew I was an amputee
 My fears could be traced to an incident that occurred one fine day in El Paso, when my first boss, Mr
 Buckeye, sent me on an errand in his very old station wagon
 I was stopped at an intersection
 I was bored to death with this task when I saw some ladies sitting and waiting for a bus directly across the street
 It was a four-way stop
 I decided to floor the gas pedal as I made a sharp left turn
 The rear wheels emitted an ear-splitting screech that freaked out the ladies sitting on the corner as the wagon's rear end fishtailed around the turn quite nicely
 I was totally enjoying testing my driving skills when a police officer who had witnessed the whole excellent driving exhibition pulled me over
 I felt I had to think of an excuse for what the officer had just witnessed
 I could not afford to pay the ticket he was sure to issue me
 In a very loud, strict tone, the officer said, "Explain to me, son, about how this reckless driving occurred
" I felt my heart would explode out of my chest, it was beating so fast
 "This is my boss's car, officer, and I'm not used to driving it
 I'm an amputee
 My foot just slipped off the brake and onto the gas pedal, causing the radical turn, sir
" I was very surprised when he said, "Show me that artificial limb, son
" I was wearing a Vocational Rehabilitation prosthesis that my   boss had allowed me to color purple
 We had colored it with a pigment used to color plastic for boat hull repairs
 When I pulled my pant leg up, the officer stared in shock and amazement as he gazed upon my purple artificial leg
 After what seemed an eternity, he said, "I'm going to let you go this time, son
 I'm not going to give you a ticket--I'm only going to give you a warning
" He also went on to say, "I'm going to spread the word about you to all the other officers in the city, and if we ever hear about anything like this happening again, we'll make sure the state takes your driver's license away for good
" He scared the hell out of me
 I had never thought of that possibility
 Wow, this is serious, I thought
 Losing my driver's license would absolutely ruin my life
 I realized that I had better be a smart and safe driver so I could always keep my driver's license
 I bet the police officers had a nice laugh about the kid with the purple leg in the police department that night! As I drove down to Florida, I thought about what was waiting for me
 I finally had a great job waiting for me in South Florida, and it was very close to the Fort Lauderdale area, where my family had settled
 A new opportunity was opening up for me to learn about and work with a very special group, an elderly population of amputees, retired people from around the country
 Chicago had been a great learning environment for me and I had greatly benefited from that work experience
 I now had seven years of experience behind me as a prosthetist and was feeling more confident than ever before about my expertise
 I also felt that I had a lot to offer my patients
 I could not wait to start work at my new job
   The patients in Florida were just as fascinating as those in the Midwest
 One of the most memorable was Elbert, a big man who worked as a laborer in a polo stable in Boca Raton
 He was absolutely the strongest man I had ever met before, even bigger than good old Sam McDermate from Evansville
 He was solidly built with huge muscles
 He was obviously not afraid of hard work
 He had a short below-knee amputation on his right leg
 I agreed to make him a replacement prosthesis, which he badly needed
 Elbert could not afford to have his artificial leg replaced on a regular basis
 In fact, a charitable organization called the Barr Foundation had arranged for him to receive his new leg
 Through the years since his childhood, Elbert's leg had become bowed, curving in a banana shape toward his other leg
 This probably had occurred because he had been unable to replace his limbs as he lost the fit and kept walking on an improperly fitting leg for long periods of time
 The human body is always changing, but the artificial limb doesn't change along with the remaining limb
 Fitting problems always develop over time
   One day as I proceeded to fit him with his new leg, he asked, "Why is this artificial leg so damn crooked? Why does it look all bent like that?" Staring at his prosthesis, I thought for a few seconds and answered him sincerely, because he truly was concerned about his prosthetic leg's appearance
 "Elbert," I said, looking him directly in the eye, "you can't put a straight leg on a crooked man
" He was quiet for a short time with a blank look on his face as he stared away from me, and then all of a sudden he just lighted up, his face smiling
 He began laughing and nodding
 We had a great time joking around during that office visit
 Prosthetics school gave me my educational base, but my patients were my real educators
 They helped me develop a mental library of successful cases and experiences to draw from throughout my career
 As similar cases came up along the way, I could quickly provide a complicated limb
 I rapidly became more adept at my craft, because I now knew how to make limbs for more difficult cases
 I had grown so confident that I could even test out jokes as I worked and see which ones the patients really liked
 I like humor a lot and enjoy hearing and seeing my patients laugh
 My humor is very dry, I'm told, but my patients seem to appreciate it
 I still use one of my favorite joking comments today: I casually tell the patient not to do any walking until I return as I go back to the lab with his or her artificial foot in my hand
 The patient, who is sitting in a chair at the end of the parallel walking bars, with a footless artificial limb on, usually grins and chuckles, happy to be able to laugh at his or her situation
 Probably the nicest comment I ever got from one of my patients was made by a local Orthodox rabbi, Rabbi B
 During one office visit he sat in front of me, quiet and saddened by the painful fit that had most recently developed on his right lower limb
 He saw the perplexed look on my face as I wondered how I could possibly make his poor-fitting right prosthetic limb more comfortable for him
 He had a busy day ahead, and until arrangements could be made to start the manufacture of a new properly fitting one, this one had to work
 In an astute, kind voice he said, "God made me this limb"--he pointed to his left limb--"and you made me this   one"--he pointed to the prosthesis--"and you can fix it
" What an astounding comment and testament to Rabbi B's trust in me
 I became energized by his wonderful motivational words and somehow figured out a combination of different adjustments that worked
 I know Rabbi B always appreciates my prosthetic work
 He makes sure I know this by thanking me most sincerely while giving me a handshake and a grateful smile with a nod
 One long workday, I was finishing up with a nice young man, Bill, having successfully provided him with a new below-the-knee-type prosthesis
 His wife, Jane, was a psychologist
 I had learned this as we became friendly and got to know each other during the frequent visits that are routine when providing a custom-made prosthetic device, especially if it's a complicated case
 As Bill walked out of the fitting room on his new leg, with crutches, Jane asked him to wait for her in the lobby because she wanted to talk to me for a few minutes
 He called out, "Okay" as he gingerly walked down the short hallway to the waiting room with a great big smile of success on his face
 I closed the door and Jane immediately asked, "Kevin, can I talk to you about Bill?" "Of course," I said
 "I am very concerned about my thirty-four-year-old husband," Jane began
 "I can see a change in him, or rather in his behavior, since the automobile accident
" He had driven off the road after falling asleep at the wheel, and collided with a concrete barrier at high speed, totally crushing his left leg well below the knee
 Jane went on to say, "I feel Bill is adjusting well to his new amputee status and even his new prosthesis, but he seems a bit agitated and abrupt with me and our two children at times
 What do you find in your patients' behavior with regard to this initial adjustment period after limb loss?" I had been helping amputees deal with their amputations for ten years now, since I had started my career
 I had helped them cope with the grief and terrible trauma of limb loss rather successfully, I thought
 I did this mostly by providing good, reliable prosthetics
 I   thought for a few seconds and tried to figure out what I could say that would help her understand what amputees go through as they try to begin accepting all that has happened to them
 I was going to talk about the anxiety everyone feels, mostly because they do not know what to expect, although the fear of rejection is very strong as well
 I encourage them to ask questions and I answer them
 This helps lower their anxiety level
 Jane didn't wait for me to answer; she looked directly into my eyes and asked me another question before I could answer the first one
 "What did you feel when you woke up after the surgery and saw for the very first time that your right foot had been amputated? When you actually saw that it was removed and gone from your body forever?" Wow, what an intense personal question coming from Jane, I thought
 I bet she is asking me this because I told her about my circumstances of limb loss at the tender age of seventeen
 Jane, professional that she was, apparently saw an opportunity to help me out as she attempted to learn and understand more about how to help her husband, whom she obviously loved very much
 I looked at her and said easily, "I just felt the tremendous pain from the actual surgical event, and immediately asked for a pain shot
" Jane kept looking me directly in the eyes as I spoke
 Suddenly she slammed the table hard with her hand--smack!--and pointed at me and shouted, "Didn't you feel angry as hell, Kevin? Didn't you feel completely pissed off?" As she was shouting and pointing at me, I kind of went into a type of trance, and to my great surprise I began to feel waves of emotion undulating through my entire body
 I was having a physical response to her words and actions
 I could not believe how I was reacting to her comments
 I tried to talk, but Jane interrupted me, insisting, "You need to allow yourself to fully express this feeling of anger, so you can become fully adjusted to the reality of the fact that you are an amputee now and always will be
" She said this as her head slowly tilted from side to side
 "I think Bill is not able to do this quite yet, and it is so important that he does, but you certainly can, right, Kevin?"   I just sat there
 "Kevin, the feeling of profound anger that you feel is a very honest feeling for you and any amputee to have
 It is very real, absolutely true and legitimate
 Don't you feel any anger about what happened to you when you were just seventeen years old?" She stared at me with kind, thoughtful eyes that actually had a twinkle of light--you know, like the eyes of an enlightened person
 I looked back at her, smiling weakly
 "Yes," I confessed
 "I have had that feeling of anger trapped inside me for so many years that it has cobwebs all over it
 I can now allow myself to really feel it, cleanse myself of it all, and let--it--go! Jane, to my amazement I just realized that I have never allowed myself to fully accept the loss of my foot and also express the honest feeling of anger about why this had to happen to me
" As she got up to leave, Jane encouraged me
 "You should just be honest with yourself, Kevin
 Remember: We all have the right to feel healthy and happy inside, so choose to be happy, Kevin, and truly be happy! I will be patient with Bill because I know my husband very well; he will completely pull through this in time
 He is a very strong, determined man, and he's a survivor like you
 Thanks, Kevin
 We will see you in two weeks for the checkup appointment
" Jane gave me a sincere hug as she passed by me to join her husband in the waiting room
 I thanked her the best that I could as she walked away
 What an awesome woman! I thought
 When Jane left the office, I felt like I could never thank her enough for what she had just helped me finally do at twenty-eight years of age
 After being an amputee for approximately ten years, I was finally ready to bear the honest truth of my destiny that I just had not been able to do in my youth: accept it all in a healthy, balanced way
 I felt so good inside--with a feeling of space, a sort of opening up and a release of pressure, an unfolding
 The anger had left me finally, and in my mind it felt like a fresh space had been created and was now available for me to put to good use, to grow into, as a person should
 I felt free, and it was absolutely amazing
 While riding home in my car after work, I realized that I had learned something new, something very important, and something more
 All these years I thought I was in balance--you know, walking   well on two well-made, straight legs
 But I really wasn't! One leg was always very crooked and remained that way for years, even after I thought time had straightened it and put me into perfect balance
 Like Elbert, I couldn't understand why a straight leg wouldn't fit on a crooked man
 I had been off balance and had refused to see it
 I thought I had adjusted well to my problems, but in reality I had never stopped being angry about them
 I had been struggling to be exactly the same as I was before, trying to ignore the fact that I would always be an amputee
 No matter how much I yearned to have my foot back and live with two normal feet again, it was never going to happen; it would never be the same
 That day I learned that holding on to anger is very bad for one's soul
 I promised myself never to do that again, no matter what else might happen to me as I went through my life
 In the future, I would always remember this promise to myself and would always work to let anger go
 I also discovered that day what a feeling actually is and how powerful feelings are, especially with regard to how they can affect your inner being
 Feelings are neither right nor wrong--they are just feelings
 But they are an important part of our individuality; they are what make us who we are
 To tell you the truth, I had never thought about feelings before that day in this deep kind of way
 I resolved to be an even more sensitive person from now on
 As I drove home after a most difficult, trying day filled with intense work, I felt I knew the direction I wanted to go in and vowed never to let anyone or anything stop me
 My vision of my future and my dreams was worth all my efforts and all my hard work
 Just as I finished reflecting on that wonderful vision, all the freeway lights magically came on all at once as far as I could see, even in the rearview mirror
 Wow, what a cool sight, seeing all those lights coming on in an instant! Oh, yes, I thought, my dreams will come true--I know it! I felt better; light always seems to help me feel better
 This is my true story, my story of survival, survival of a catastrophe that occurred in my blameless, most sensitive youth
 I never saw it coming, and even when I did, I had absolutely no way to prepare for it or deal with it
 My past demonstrates a kind of power   of self-determination that was necessary for me to carry on and get through my life just the way I wanted to
 I sought very much to live as normal a life as humanly possible--you know, to simply fit in and do well
 This resolve enabled me to endure the terrible suffering that I was forced into and yet to become a successful man in spite of it
 I simply chose to keep myself on a path of determined success, always working hard, always looking ahead and never giving up
 I learned not to dwell on everything I couldn't do but instead chose to focus on everything I could do
 Most important, I discovered over time that giving up what I loved to do out of fear of rejection, like swimming, dancing, and wearing shorts on hot days, was totally unwarranted
 I had absolutely no help from some individuals who stood in my way and tried to hold me back, but I chose not to let them block me from achieving my dreams
 I overcame my fears with the greatest difficulty at times, but this was actually the most rewarding of all my experiences, conquering my fears
 All along the way I had help from family and good, very good, friends who were so helpful and meaningful to me that I can't even put into words how greatly I appreciated it
 I could begin to cry just thinking about their level of commitment to my life and me
 I could summarize and just say that they were all gifts from God
 Most important of all I learned that the most central thing to keep in my life is something very simple: to protect my God-given happy spirit, in spite of all the sadness and problems I have been through or may yet face
 I believe things always have a way of working out
 In fact, today I am the owner of a successful prosthetics practice and married to the woman of my dreams
 I am the father of five beautiful children and the grandfather of four beautiful grandchildren, and I am looking forward to all the new spectacular arrivals yet to come
 The Beginning
