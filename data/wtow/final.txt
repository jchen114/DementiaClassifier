 Prior to being called to the Bar, I decided to get a secondary qualification, in view of the state of uncertainty in industry in 
 So I started a course reading the University of London's Postgraduate Certificate in Education at St  Mary's College, Strawberry Hill, Twickenham
 In  I obtained my Postgraduate Certificate in Education
 This was vital in getting a post as a lecturer instructor and Assistant Educational Psychologist at HM Prison, Wormwood Scrubs
 This was intended to support me financially until my call to the Bar, and so it did
 In the prison I took classes in English, Current Affairs, History, Constitutional Law,and Geography
 The prison was memorable in that it was a first offenders' prison, mainly peopled by convicted murderers and spies
 Spies in my classes included Col
 Lonsdale, the Russian KGB Officer, who was eventually exchanged for Gary Powers, the U pilot, and John Vassell, the Admiralty spy, and lastly George Blake, the double agent
  Blake was responsible for the details of many British agents
 He confessed in  to having passed Moscow copies of every important official document that he saw
 I was so appalled by Blake's crimes that he must be the only person I have ever refused to shake hands with
 He was sentenced to forty two years imprisonment
 He was in my Current Affairs class
 Then in ,   by which time I had taken another job, he escaped over the wall into a waiting car and ending up in Moscow where he still is
 Most of my studying for my call to the Bar was done between and after the classes in the prison library, in my local library at Hammersmith, and my flat near Barnes Common
 I lectured for three years at Wormwood Scrubs
   In one of my classes I had a Middle Eastern murderer
 After a while I had formed the impression that this man could not have murdered someone in the street and cut off his head
 He was too pleasant and easy going a character
 Then one day I just caught a glimpse of a look of malice and sheer evil towards a fellow prisoner, and instantly I changed my view
 How wrong can one be in an assessment of a character! This was an important lesson for me to learn, both in later jobs and in the outside world, that has stayed with me
  Later I transferred to making assessments in a remand home for young criminals, where the lessons learned in Wormwood Scrubs were put into practice
 Particularly, the lessons I had learnt as Assistant Educational Psychologist in the Scrubs proved useful
 Between pm and pm most evenings I returned to Wormwood Scrubs to lecture at evening classes
 The young criminals in the remand centre were assessed for transfer to their next place of incarceration by me and I wrote reports for each person, usually during the class whilst the students were completing set exercises
  Having attended the required number of dinners at Gray's Inn, one of the four Inns of Court, in  I had the great pleasure of being called to the Bar as a barrister
 I was presented with a book on The Duty and Art in Advocacy by the late Devlin J
, Treasurer of Gray's lnn
 My speech that night at the Gray's lnn dinner was in Latin Nunc in Latin Nunc in Lingua Latina
 Great fun! A colleague made his speech in Russian
 It won't surprise the reader that neither of us was allowed by our colleagues to finish! I then became a member of the Bar Association of Commerce, Industry and Finance, and worked as a nonpractising barrister in industry, as indeed did many others

    Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the places and moments that take our breath away
 Anonymous
 For me my expedition to Egypt in  was one such piece, and a series of such moments
 A group of my friends from various colleges met in an Oxford College common room
 Having been called to the Bar in , it was decided that I would drive with three friends to Piraeus, the port for Athens, and cross by boat to Alexandria where we were to be met by two South African friends with their Land Rover
 I attended six illustrated lectures on the tomb of Tutankhamun: I had previously done preparatory work on Egyptology
 The roads to Greece were fine to Thessaloniki and beyond to the Turkish border, after which there was just tracks to lstanbul
  I arranged to leave the car for a few months in Athens
 We then joined our two South African colleagues with their Land Rover
 The South Africans had erected a tough wire cage over the rear for security
 We then sailed from Piraeus to Alexandria, passing Crete on a fine summer night
 Our party had three people essential to our mission: an engineer, a doctor, and an Egyptologist, (me)
  From Alexandria we drove to Giza, just outside Cairo and camped in what used to be the grounds of King Farouk's palaces, with the pyramids showing up against the warm night sky
 The next day we climbed up a rather tenuous route to the top of the Great Pyramid of Cheops
 We viewed the Giant Sphinx and rode on a camel, then set for Asyut, passing the Step Pyramid of Saqqara and a cluster of nine pyramids
 Then there was the long drive to Asyut and on to Luxor: Karnak and Luxor are two of the most impressive temples in Egypt
 	 But the piece de resistance was the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens on the West Bank of the Nile
 We had to recross the Nile by ferry to get there, passing on the way the Colossi of Memnon
 The Mortuary Temple of Queen Hatshepsut rises out of the Desert in a series of terraces that merge with the limestone cliffs
 I deliberately investigated the Valley of the Kings on my own, staying there for half an hour, taking in the pervading atmosphere of this incredible place
 One had to know what happened there to fully appreciate this valley
 We then drove a long distance to Aswan near the First Cataract
 After the building of the High Dam (), the monuments were relocated to a nearby island
 At Aswan we did not camp for a change, but stayed at the Catholic Mission for while in a big dormitory
 We stayed so we could contact the Egyption military who would appoint a compulsory guide to lead us over the stretch of the Sahara between Aswan and Abu Simbel and get a BBC film unit to join us
 We talked animatedly far into the night with our fellow Egyptian army officers
 A wonderful evening!   The next day I then decided we would drive the Land Rover around the Aswan Dam building works being carried out by the Soviets, utilising my Russian language learnt in the army
 All   fascinating! I was taught the Russian language by Princess Coe, a White Russian in York
 The Egyptian colonel arranged a Bedouin guide who knew the Sahara
 We joined up with the BBC film unit in their Land Rover, who accompanied us over the next three days
 The next day we passed a vast unexpected camel graveyard
 I got a photo of this through the windscreen
 On the third day, we reached the impressive rock temples at Abu Simbel and facade of huge statues
 We entered deep into the temples
 The Great Temple is now at the foot of the new Lake Nasser
 UNESCO had the temples cut from the hill and moved them to an artificial cliff well above their original position
 On the way back, we had the dreadful misfortune of knocking down and injuring a child in the village, who ran out without warning in front of our vehicle, in respect of which all seven of us were put in the village jail with a barred window overlooking the village square
 I gave this cell the name 'Black Hole of Calcutta'
 It was only weeks after the British invasion of Suez and this did not bode well
 We spent the night on the floor
 The next day we were suddenly released, apparently because of an urgent phone call from the UK Ambassadar in Cairo, clearing us of any liability
 Apart from this terrible incident, wow, did I love, love, love this exciting and incredibly long holiday! The memories will remain with me forever
 There were many good times before and after, but nothing quite like this
  When I first met my future wife, Pauline Whitley, not long after my return from Egypt, at a fancy dress party in Chelsea, I was wearing a fez and a white sheet and sandals! All of this must have gone down well for the rest of the story is history!    In  I was elected a Fellow of the Salzburg Seminar in American Studies after a London interview
 I was then asked to attend a month's session at the Schloss Leopoldskron which in my view had almost the status of a US overseas university: a beautiful venue
 This was situated in a fine mansion on a lakeside outside Salzburg
 The session was entitled American Law and Legal lnstitutions and attended by many other Fellows from all over Europe, including three from Czechoslovakia
 The Faculty Professors included Prof
 Cardozo, one time Professor of Law at Cornell University, USA, and a US government consultant
 This course was to add significantly to my First Class Certificate in Foreign Law and Comparative Law, , at the City of London College (now London University)
  I had the happy experience of meeting professional Europeans every day for a month, and made many friends
 The beer cellar after each day's work was socially a marvellous place to have many a fascinating conversation, far into the evenings
 Sitting beside the beautiful lake on a hot summer's day with such company was quite delightful and something I will always remember
 It was here that I first became conscious of being noticeably less insular and more European
   A coachload of us made a threeday visit to Prague, Czechoslovakia, three weeks before the Russian invasion
 My three Czech colleagues did not accompany us
  l shall never forget the massive menacing towers at the frontier crossing with a steel barrier across the road from Austria
 For the first time I experienced the horrific actuality of the Cold War
 Steely eyes on each gruesome and menacing tower were trained on every move we made
 This is something one had to experience to understand what had been going on in Czechoslovakia at that time
 So began three incredible days, so close to Salzburg
 Those three days will stay with me always
  We stayed at the Charles University in a large dormitory
 I was woken up very early one morning by an immense clattering from the main road outside the University: a noise which i was quite convinced was being made by tanks, the sound of which I had got used to in my army days
 If so, that could only be Russian tanks, as an invasion was halfexpected
  I was mightily relieved when I eventually got to the window
 It transpired that the noise was being caused by trams passing over sewers not far from the road surface!  That day we had people coming up to us, asking for help to escape to Austria
 This got quite embarassing and awful to have to refuse
 Altough Prague was a fine city, I was quite pleased to get back to the dreaded frontier post after three days
 About three weeks later the Russian invasian actually started and the Russians took over the city
  Pauline and I went to Prague on a week's holiday much later, long after the Berlin Wall had fallen and the Russians had left, when I saw a very different city
  More recently the Salzburg Seminar became the Salzburg   Global Seminar and I and all the others became Fellows of the Salzburg Global Seminar, rather than Fellows of the Salzburg Seminar
 Long may this splendid institution carry on its good work
   On my return from Salzburg, I had an interview with Dr
 Alan Milner, a fellow of Trinity College, and formally Dean at Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria
 Alan told me that in addition to his fellowship at Trinity, he had started to produce the African Law Reports, with help from the Ford Foundation
 Both Alan and I were both barristers at law at Gray's Inn
  As a result of the interview, Alan appointed me Commercial Series Editor of the African Law Reports
 Another fellow barrister, Rupert Bursell, was one of my five Editorial Associates
 Alan arranged that my family and I would live in a university block of flats occupied by visiting University Fellows
    My native African carvings came from Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone
 I have four of them
 When I look at my African carvings, I am reminded of the time I visited Freetown for one week there was a riot at the time
  In May  I flew out to Freetown, by way of The Gambia, West Africa, before landing at the airport for Freetown
 I had the misfortune of arriving in the midst of an uprising
  Our coach weaved its way through a vast crowd of people, marching army officers and senior NCOs (NonCommissioned Officers) in chains down the main road
  I saw the riot for only about five minutes
 I saw more of the results of it, but it lives on in one's mind that sort of thing
 One does not expect to see it, a public riot against the army
 I did not know what to expect, after all I wasn't in my own country and it was my first time in Africa
 I was the only English person there and everyone looked at me thinking, 'Who are you?' I did not go out much after that
 Some start to my trip! Eventually I managed to get to the paramount hotel overlooking Freetown Bay
  I was in Freetown for a week
 One of the purposes of the visit was to inspect old law manuscripts, only I quickly discovered they had all been eaten by termites!  I met the Hon
 Sir Samuel Bankole Jones, President of the Court of Appeal for Sierra Leone, who sent a car round to my hotel for me, and we talked for a long time in his house
 He told me that his wife had had to get him out of his house in the boot of his car during the riots
 Later that week he took me on several trips to the coast
  After a wonderful week, I flew back to the UK and Oxford, loaded with African bits and pieces, all of which I still have  a drum, a spear, horns, four African wooden heads, amongst other things  all displayed in front of my African Law Reports and shown on the photo, a permanent reminder of those wonderful days in West Africa
   When I got back to the UK after one week (there was only one plane per week), I responded to a fascinating job advertisement for a legal job in Brussels
 I was chosen for this job for the Clark Equipment Company of the USA
  I remember the second part of my interview as it was in a nightclub where I ended up with an attractive hostess on my knee,   and my reactions were watched with keen interest
 I was a very good dancer at this time, I took to the floor with this lady and when I returned to my interviewers, I received a grand round of applause
 After being offered the job, I flew out to the midwest of the US with my family and began my six months of training for the post in Brusseis
   I have chosen to write about a place where I was particularly happy, and made plenty of friends, many of whom inspired me
 That place was the USA
 My wife and I and our two young children, Philip and Sarah, were given the use of a large house not far from the Clark Equipment Company's Headquarters, together with the largest car I have ever driven
  I was appointed UK Counsel and Assistant European Counsel to take effect when I had returned to Europe after my training in the USA
 After three months my family and I opted to take over a large farm house with forty acres of forest in Barron Lake in Michigan to the great delight of Philip and Sarah
  We were invited to colleagues' houses and in return we entertained them
 One fascinating invitation was to meet a considerable number of people who wanted to meet people from England: what fun!  there were many outoftheway office visits for us, some business and some social, to Washington DC, New York, Detroit, Minneapolis, Chicago and London, Ontario
  We spent an amazing six months in this atmosphere before sailing to France on the QE and enjoying one hout longer each night, dancing
 What an incredible six months' introduction to the Clark Equipment Company
 I cannot recall a more wonderful six months with such marvellous people
  Once we had arrived in France, we drove to Brussels, and   more wonderful experiences
 When working in Brussels, part of my job was to fly to the UK and back on the company plane every two weeks, and I stayed in the company flat in Mayfair during my time in the UK
 I made many interesting visits to the UK Company in Camberley where I worked with the Managing Director and the lndustrial Relations Manager
 I gave lectures to the employees, as there was much new employment statute law in the UK at the time
 Thanks to the company plane, other parts of the country were also visited
  Lectures were also given to senior employees on the Treaty of Rome, , which established the Common Market
 In Brussels I was only the second ever British barrister, although there may have been a British Solicitor
 In my final years there I undertook EEC translation work from French to English and English to French with my wife
  South India,  l have always been interested in India, since my school days studying the close connection with lndia of our fellow countrymen, from setting up the East India Company and the arrival of Clive in India
 I had listened with fascination to many who served in the Indian Army
   It was therefore a great pleasure for my wife Pauline, and me, to fly to India on th, December  for about a month
  The Benedictine Ashram of Shantivanam in Tamil Nadu sent a vehicle to collect us from the airport of Tiruchirappalli, (or Trichy), to take us to Shantivanam Ashram close to the River Kaveri
 The Ashram had been founded by three French Benedictines
  In  the English Benedictine, Bede Griffiths, arrived from England
 Worship at the church, according to the Syrian Christian and Latin Benedictine traditions, was set out in the Ashram prayer book, Sandhya Vandana
 This was the meeting point of the church's liturgy of Christ and the Rishis, of east and west, the creation of the said Bede Griffiths, and his French predecessors
  We were met at the adjacent Ananda Ashram, preceded over by the indomitable and delightful Sr
 Marie Louise
 We were soon to suffer from the attentions of mosquitos
 Happily, there were mosquito nets over the beds in each chalet
 I was ably assisted by a little team of friendly frogs and lizards
 One frog used to wait outside the door to be let in the evenings: better than being eaten by the ever present paddy birds
 Masilla, who looked after us,   kindly disposed of a scorpion who ventured too close
 Pauline and I ventured along the banks of the River Kaveri and absorbed the sights and sounds of nature at its most beautiful
 The sun was streaming through the trees
 A bullock and cart were crossing the ford
 Further down, boys were playing cricket on a sandbank
  My wife and I were persuaded to dress in an lndian outfit, of which we have a photo
 One of the best aspects of this holiday were the many friendships we made with wonderful people from Germany, England, Canada, USA, Holland and Calcutta
  Along the banks of the Kaveri, people wash and carry out cremations: death is accepted as a matter of course here
 There is both a Hindu and a Christian graveyard on the river bank
  On th December we were honoured by the visit to Ananda Ashram of the bestselling author, Dominique Lapierre, writer of the City of Joy (i
e
 Calcutta), and his wife
 A number of us were invited to hear him talk after dinner about his experiences both of writing and of running charities in India
 He donates half his royalties to the poor of Calcutta
 Gaston Dayanand stayed in a nearby chalet: he looked after the poor and lepers of Calcutta, often working with Mother Theresa
 We both felt very honoured meeting these two men
  December th was Bede Griffiths' birthday
 Bede's simple hut was left as it was the day he died, still pervaded by the spirit of this great Englishman
 In addition, the entire village was invited to lunch and served by Ashram workers
 We found this a most moving experience
 All of us were invited to a meal eaten from large banana leaves, sitting in the lotus position
  Not long after, we went to the opening of the kindergarten school and tailoring school
 There was lndian dancing
 I spent a happy hour distributing one sweet each to hundreds of joyful and well behaved children
  On st December we visited a spectacular temple in Srirangam
 Then, on Christmas Day, we celebrated far from home
 The church was decorated by flower garlands in memory of our son Philip on the seventh anniversary of his death
  The Tsunami tremors were felt at the Ashram on the th December
 We talked to a couple who had just returned from an awfui car journey in which they were faced with a tsunami wave heading straight for them, preceded by fleeing people
 They managed to rescue four people
 Pauline arranged a hastily prepared candlelit vigil at the church and a collection for Tsunami victims
 All in all, a very tragic day
    I was admitted as a Solicitor of the Supreme Court at the Law Society in , after nineteen years as a Barrister in industry
 I ran a Solicitor's branch office at Tilehurst, near Reading
  On th November , I started work as a locum solicitor with Blackburn, Gittings  Nott, a criminal law solicitor's firm in Westminster, to run their noncriminal wo	rk so that they could specialise completely in criminal law work
  I created a company with the name Ryan  Co
 on th June , on the top floor of Blackburn, Gittings  Nott offices in Westminster
 Blackburn, Gittings  Nott passed me their noncriminal legal work from their clients who had criminal law problems
 After some consideration, I accepted their top floor office to assist in setting me up in business on my own account as the firm of Ryan  Co
, at their offices in Buckingham Palace Road
  A transcendental Meditation colleague that I met at Roydon Hall, East Peckham, agreed to join the firm and did so on the rd August 
 At the beginning she was my Secretary, but it soon transpired that she was skilled enough to be my Personal Assistant and acted as the firm's internal Accountant and virtually as an Articled Clerk, and so it was
  Initially, my clients were employees of the Queen at Buckingham Palace, which was close by
 Many of the rest were clients who had been accused of a crime, and came from Blackburn, Gittings  Nott
 Eventually, I used to joke that my clients were either defendants accused of crimes or aristocrats and this continued into my next office
  The business at the Buckingham Palace Road office expanded, so I had to expand the number of employees
 On rd May , I took much larger premises at Leader House, Shaftesbury Avenue, London, in the middle of theatreland
 The business became mainly buying and selling large hotels, and this became quite lucrative
  Ryan  Co
 was an unusual, slightly idiosyncratic firm of solicitors, in that I only came to employ people practising Transcendental Meditation
 All of my employees I met at or through the TM Academy at Roydon Hall, East Peckham, Kent
 These included a part time actress from the London Repertory Theatre Company
 All of us started and ended each day with a twenty minute meditation
  Interestingly, many clients remarked on the efficient, peaceful, and happy atmosphere in the office
 We all knew precisely why this was and were delighted with these comments
  The business was also unusual in that the clients were split into two very distinctive elements, first, the aristocratic smart set and theatre clients and secondly the people accused of crimes that I had inherited from Blackburn, Gittings  Nott
 The former were mainly initially introduced to the firm by our meditating estate agent who had arranged to lease Leader House, where the office was, to my firm
 We tried not to mix the two client groups in the office at the same time!  Another unusual aspect of the firm was that we all took it in   turns to buy our vegetables etc
 for lunch from the local market nearby, and then share in the preparation of the lunch in our kitchen
 The others did not fare too well when I was the cook! In addition, I used to take all my employees on a tour of interesting places such as the nearby British Museum
  All in all, not quite your usual firm of solicitors: happy days! Regrettably, it all finished in June  when I had to close the office because the economic climate had such a disastrous effect on the business of buying and selling hotels and property in general
  In addition to the commercial conveyancing, there was insufficient other business, like my probate business, to make it profitable in that venue
 This was the time that many solicitors, particularly the small ones, closed
  With a heavy heart, I surrendered the lease and gradually ran the business down between my house in Wingham and that of my Personal Assistant, near Dartford, for a year afterwards
  I survived financially by commencing locum work with nearby Mobil Oil Co
 Ldt
,  Victoria Street, SW, on September th 
 The Mobil Oil work was fascinating new work for me
 After Mobil Oil, I commenced locum work from Croydon in the area of commercial conveyancing and town and country planning
 The planning was most welcome because I needed this experience to use in future posts, which I did to great effect
 In fact, latterly, planning became my new and strongest area of the law
  After Croydon, a local Deal Solicitor, wanted to lease the Old Stables attached to our house
 The Old Stables Pauline and I had subsequently converted into an an antique shop with her father's help
 The solicitor planned to convert this into a solicitor's office as part of his business
 I turned down this idea and he then offered me a post with his firm in Deal, Dover and Canterbury
 I accepted his offer and worked in all three offices
   After my timely referral to a Senior Clinical Psychologist on the th January , I underwent a long series of written tests at the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Heme Bay and later at my home
  I was referred for an MRI scan on the nd April 
 Having been diagnosed as having Mixed Dementia with Alzheimer's Disease', I was then referred to the memory clinic at St Martin's Hospital in Canterbury
  After a hectic few days there was preoccupation and then a quiet acceptance of my own mortality, given my diagnosis
 I cannot say enough for the Senior Clinical Psychologist and her competence and general helpfulness when visiting me at home
 She kindly offered to keep me on her books for the time being, to which I readily agreed, even after completing my Cognitive Stimulation therapy course
 She visited me at home on th March, 
  On completion of this course, it became clear to me that I should join the ForgetMeNots Group in Cantebury
 This proved to be an excellent decision
  The group comprises of people living with dementia, clinical psychologists, unversity psychology placement students and a consultant clinical psychologist
 Meeting by meeting I gradually learnt a considerable amount in order to play a more meaningful role in the group
  I soon became a number of participatory activities such as writing to Cabinet Ministers in response to questions posed to people with dementia, helping to interview and choose candidates for various posts at local memory clinics, and meeting and having a long and detailed conversation with the House of Lords
  Following my diagnosis of Mixed Dementia with Alzheimer's Disease, I devised what I call my Daily Battle Plan!  With regards to tackling dementia, I very soon conceived the idea of creating a Battle Plan
 As a result of which I really believe that I have slowed down the progression of this condition
  The plan comprised of a number of different approaches and I shall happily summarise them to you one by one:  My Battle Plan Acupressure for Memory and Understanding:   Acupressure is the ancient Chinese art of selfhealing
 I press the relevant acupressure points, thereby generating a sense of harmony, health and wellbeing
 After using pressure on two particular points, I increased blood flow from virtually nil (considering I have two blocked arteries), to a very acceptable rate in just two weeks!  Applying pressure to another two points, pulses on both sides synchronised and I achieved a balance between both hemispheres of the brain
  I used the book, Acupressure by Michael Reed Gach (), to learn and understand more about accupressure
    My wife and I attend the Kings School Recreation Centre, Canterbury, once every week
 The first class I attended was a onetoone exercise class, which was geared to each individual
  The Exercise Physiologist, who guided me through, kindly provided me with specially drawn up directions to carry out the exercises with appropriate diagrams of what to do and how to do it
 I make sure this side of things is never neglected if time is short for whatever reason
 I attend these sessions with a reflexologist from Holistic Health in Canterbury
 At home I also use a reflexology massager
 The body is divided up into ten longitudinal zones, five on each side of the vertical line
 All the organs of the body are covered, including the brain
 All in our family started to practice this several years ago
 It reduces stress and increases efficiency, to all of which I can testify
  Transcendental Meditation aims to operate from the 'source of thought', a state of 'pure awareness,' to which I can also testify
  Some years ago I operated from the source of thought for three weeks and found myself thinking at least twice as fast a I do usually, as a result of which many in my company used to seek my opinion for a host of problems in that time span
 Quite early on, after my diagnosis, I wrote to the project director of the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing, relating to vitamins B, B and B and received his reply
 This project has been working on a cure for Alzheimer's since before 
 I like to stay up to date with research related to dementia as part of my daily battle plan
 Being a retired Lawyer, one of my earliest actions was to prepare two draft Lasting Powers of Attorney, one for my wife and one for me
 This was difficult as this was a new area of the law to me, so I decided to get a specialized firm of solicitors to check what I had done
 The L
P
A was eventually sent to me by the office of the public Guardian
 Much more recently, I contacted Dr
 B
 Fileof the Coconut Research Centerin Colorado Springs, U
S
A
 I wrote to him with regard to his important article at www
coconutresearchcenter
org on conquering Alzheimer's with Coconut Ketones
 My email to Dr
 Fife raised questions with regard to his new drug consisting of medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) that are converted into   Ketones in the body
 This drug was approved by the US Federal Drug Administration for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease
  I had a helpful reply by return and I then went on to buy Stop Alzheimer's Now
 I am now following his recommendations
  Choral Music Therapy:  I play CD'S every day during my daily programmes at home, which induce an overall calm and happy serenity throughout
 There are some particular choices of music which I enjoy and I would like to tell you about a few of these
  a) Rachmaninoff's Vespers  First comes, Rachmaninoff's Vespers, Tenebrae's All Night Vigil by Nigel Short and recorded live as part of the North Wales international Music Festival in St Asaph's Cathedral, St Asaph in 
 The Russian singing has brought back the really wonderful memories of many years ago, bringing back the Russian language I learned when in the Intelligence Corps
  Great indeed was the singing of Priidite, Poklonimsya (Come, Let us worship) and Blagoslavi, Dushe Moya, Gospoda (Bless the Lord, O My Soul)
 I still have from the s my old army exercise book full of Russian writing, which came with Pauline and me on our cruise in  to St
 Petersburg
  b) King's college Chapel Choirs, Cambridge: The choral music and the peace on those heady days and after The annual Christmas Eve () TV broadcast covering the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols from King's College Chapel, Cambridge, gently preceded us into Christmas
 Christmas carols were the earliest form of vernacular choral literature
  Before the Reformation, Catholic England combined English and Latin texts and then the Anglican Church gallantly built on this tradition
 Now the wheel has turned full circle and the UK Ordinariate of Our Lady Walsingham has reintroduced her Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols initiated by King's College Chapel, much to the benefit of that Church
 In addition, the Cambridge Singers' two CDs directed by John Rutter, Lighten Our Darkness, and Music for the Close of Day were played, recorded in the Lady Chapel of Ely Cathedral in 
  c) Mechtild of Magdeburg: Songs of the Mystical Life  Mechtiid of Magdeburg (or Mechthild) (c
  c
) a German th century Beguine mystic of the Cistercian nunnery of Helfta near Eisleben, known to us through her book, The Flowing Light of the Godhead, written in her native Saxony
 Her book is a kind of spiritual journal
  d) John Rutter: Music for Christmas by the Cambridge Singers A journalist has written: 'Rutter has become the musical equivalent of Dickens, synonymous with the season of Christmas'
   I appreciate Rutter's music as never before: it permeates and suffuses every fibre of one's being
 It totally involves all one's   senses
 An intense love of music from some time in the past was reborn and reactivated with immense energy, this time with far more knowledge of the composers and their music
  Amazing to think it has taken eighty years for all this to flower in full bloom: what absolute joy!  e) Margaret Rizza's Psalms Some of Margaret Rizza's Psalms emanate from the St
 Thomas Music Group directed by Rizza
 They have appeared in her albums, Fountain of Life, Fire of Love and Light on Our Darkness
 Rizza's hauntingly beautiful melodies are recognised around the world as an icon in Christian Composition
  f) Clare College Choir, Cambridge: Compline with Anthems and Motets  Preceded by Compline with Anthems and Motets, I listen to the singing and music from Clare College, Cambridge
 Composers included John Sheppard, William Byrd, Thomas Tallis, and Sergei Rachmanirov
  Clare Choir is considered one of the leading univserity choral groups in the UK
 Clare I remembered well, having walked to work along a wonderful route twice a day for years across the Clare Bridge and through Clare, which I shall never forget
  g) Tenebrae: Allegri Miserere Signum Classics describe Allegri's haunting Miserere as 'the central point in a journey of longing and entreaty, hope and faith
 These works spanning the centuries are chosen from the heart of Tenebrae's concert repertoire'
 Two of the items were by the late John Tavener
  I) John Tavener: BT Scottish Ensemble  I play the Orthodox Church's John Tavener's Tears of the Angels, Depart in Peace and My Gaze is Ever Upon You
 Here was someone else who has experienced being preoccupied with his own mortality, and whom Pauline and I saw at a Canterbury Cathedral musical event recently
  i) Spirit of Peace, Sounds from Ampleforth and hymns from St
 Magnus Cathedral, Orkney  The Spirit of Peace CD, sung by the monks of Ampleforth Abbey, brings back memories of part of the traditional repertoire of sacred music known as the Gregorian Chant
 This wonderful CD commenced with Vexilla Regis and finished with the powerful Christus Vincit
 I also played Sounds from Ampleforth and Hymn to St
 Magnus, performed by the St Magnus Cathedral choir, Kirkwall, Orkney
  j) Buddhist Chants and Peace Our CD Buddhist Chants and Peace music for reflection and relaxation from the Far East provides the beginning temple sounds of Buddhism with an almost primal allure to the listener
    I opened my eyes
 The room was dark except for the flickering light of the nightlight on the chest of drawers
 I saw my father with a pillow under his arm
 What's the matter, Daddy? I said
 'Hush,' he replied
 'You'll wake the others
' 'What are you doing?' I asked
 'There's a draught, blowing the night light
 Now, go back to sleep! I saw my father put the pillow down behind the gas fire in the fireplace
  I woke again to find the room in complete darkness  the nightlight must have gone out
 I was aware that something soft and damp was in the bed  my nightdress was wet
 I dimly realised that my baby sister was asleep next to me: how horrid! I thought, how did she get into my bed? Later on, our nursemaid lifted the baby out of the bed and told me to get up and take off my wet nightie
 She then gave me my clothes to get dressed  it was very strange and still dark
  Down in the kitchen the range was burning warm and comforting
 My grandmother and grandfather were there, sitting by the fire but still wearing their black overcoats
 My grandmother was still wearing her large black hat
 'Drink your milk,' said my mother
 I hated milk
 'I don't like it,' I said
   'I'll put some sugar in it,' said my mother
  It was still horrible
  'You do make such a fuss,' said my mother
 'You need some food inside you
 You are going with Gran to her house in Essex  it's a long drive!'   I felt sick
 I always felt sick on long car journeys
 Barbara had eaten her porridge and drunk her milk
 'Why can't you be like Barb? said my mother
 'Don't grumble at her!' said my Gran
 'She'll probably go to sleep in the car!  It was still dark and cold when we got into the back seat of the car
 The leather was slippery and cold and the thick blanket did not make me feel warm
 The car started and went slowly down the drive
  I already felt sick
  We stayed with my grandparents for a year and returned to Ramsgate three months after war broke out
 We were evacuated to Staffordshire two weeks later
 My mother was living in a small bungalow
 My father was not there
  I never saw my father again
 His name was never mentioned in my hearing
    I think that we never had much money, although we lived in a large house and kept several staff, including a cook and a nursery maid
 My father kept hens in an orchard on the other side of the road and cultivated the large garden himself, with two enormous greenhouses with fruit like apricots and tomatoes in one, and in the other cucumbers and melons
 His real job' was writing books, mainly on the history of dog breeds and research into spiders and insects
  The hairdresser, who was called Mr Blunt, came to the house to cut our hair once a month
 One after another we were cloaked in the white cape, made to sit 'absolutely still' while the tickly hairs fell down the face and the horrid clippers went up the back of the neck
 When the bob and fringe were finished, a soft brush went over our closed eyes, our noses, mouths and necks
 I never enjoyed 'haircut days'!  One such day, just after my sixth birthday, Mr Blunt gave me a small blue leathercovered box
 Inside was a gold cross and chain
 I realised it was jewellery  something we had never had before
  It was not pretty
 It was not appropriate either: we were brought up agnostic
 Religion was never mentioned
 Worst of all, engraved on the back of the cross: Billy, October'   Although I had never been to school, I knew my name was spelled 'Billie'
  i was six years old and my sister was five
 We had returned from my grandparents' cottage in Essex and stayed for two weeks in a modern bungalow at Chiltern near Ramsgate
 There was a funny pale green board, on a post, on the lawn in front of the house
 My mother said it was to detect poison gas
 i didn't understand, but it sounded very scary
  One morning the taxi arrived and we were taken, with our gas masks and very few belongings (Barbara carried her wellchewed TeddyBear, but i had to leave mine behind as it was 'too large')
 We arrived at the railway station in Ramsgate and joined a large group of children of a similar age, all with gas masks slung across their shoulders
  Many were crying
 Many mothers were crying also
 My mother was not, but could not bear to see the train depart
 We were left with a teacher and made friends with some girls
 My mother kissed us goodbye, and left to take the taxi back to her bungalow
  The train journey was exciting, but very long
 i was glad it was not a car journey, though i still felt sick
 Barbara was crying, so I felt I couldn't cry
 We got to Stafford
 A woman tied a label on each of us  she said it was so that my sister and i wouldn't be separated
  Finally, a couple came forward and told us we were their evacuees
 The woman, unsmiling, took our hands
 Her husband walked behind us and did not speak
 Someone drove us to a   village about fifteen miles from Stafford, out in the countryside, to a brand new council house, so new the garden was just rubble
 i did not cry I felt that, although it was all horrible, the people were probably doing their best
  Wren Pack,' Leaden Roding My grandparents lived in a small cottage with a large, uncultivated garden and a ditch at the bottom, (or the 'brook' as my grandmother preferred to call it!), on which there were moorhens
 There was no running water except for the pump over a stone sink in the kitchen
 The privy was right down the garden, near the ditch
 My grandmother had to light paraffin lamps in the evening and candles showed us the way to bed
 Everything in the house had a funny smell  possibly from the oil or from the open fire or the stove in the kitchen
 Grandfather was often absent, still working at sixtyeight as a pilot on ships out of London
 I didn't realise how dangerous this must have been until recently when I saw some documents from Trinity House
    This piece of writing came in a session where Liz asked the writers questions, and we had to answer quickly, without any thinking time, just writing the first response that came into our minds
 Write the name of someone you know  My sister, Barbara Jean Anne
 She's eleven months younger than I am
 Her pet name was Deeo'
 List anything that comes into your head as you think of that person  Not allowed to go out
  Tell me what's inside that person's refrigerator?  it's fairly empty: meat  not wrapped, not covered (she argues with me about bacteria)
 Very little else  some butter, goats cheese
 It's a very large refrigerator, as she lived in Spain
  What would she do with ?  Buy a bottle of brandy  and several more maybe! Think about food you have shared with this person  what comes to mind? I have a photograph of my sister and me fighting over a glass of something, juice or cordial
 My sister's eleven months younger than i, but by the time she was four she was taller than i was
  What smells are you reminded of when you think of her?  I think she smoked at the time, when I last saw her in Greece since I didn't smoke I was always conscious of other people smelling of cigarettes
  When you picture this person, where are they?  At home, on her boat it's very tidy, and very sparsely furnished
 What made you choose this person?  She's my younger sister it just came into my head how I miss her
 What is she doing when you think of her now?  She doesn't communicate now  I don't know why  it's all mixed   up with things that have happened since the last time i saw her on her boat in 
  If you could ask her a question right now, what would it be?  Couldn't you just keep in touch?  I have a tall stoneware vase
 it is a good shape with imaginative glazing  a fine piece of 'Canterbury Pottery'
 The vase was a present i was given when i was leaving the school where i had been teaching for almost seven years
 Mark was a third year boy who came to my afterschooi cookery club
 He was bigger than most of the other boys of his age and very assertive  sometimes quite a pain in the neck! i often had to reprimand him for his boisterous behaviour  not appropriate in a Home Economics room! i sometimes felt that i grumbled at him too much  after all, it was a voluntary club
 On the last day of term, Mark came to my room and handed me a large, carefully wrapped parcel
 He said, 'I bought this for you, Miss, to thank you for teaching me to cook
 l unwrapped the beautiful vase and was so overcome that i wept
    Thanks to my gorgeous wife, Rachael: you are my harbour of peace and serenity in the sometimes stormy and tumultuous seas of life
    Rosemary Cottage is situated in the village where i grew up, Which nestles beside the River Thames in Royal Berkshire
 in , two cottages were built for staff at the Manor House and, some  years ago, these two cottages were joined together to form Rosemary Cottage
 it's a Grade Two Listed Building, consisting of numerous oak beamed rooms and oddly shaped hideyholes
 It is possible to sit within the alcove where the fireplace is, but best not when it's lit! Above the front door is a metal plaque for the Sun Alliance, dating back to the days when fire brigades, run by insurance companies, would only answer a firecall if you were a member
 lf not, the house was allowed to burn down!  Over its  years, it has been a butcher's, a th Century coffee shop, a laundry, and Civil Defence offices during World War II, as well as being a residential property
 in my early years, i had friends that lived in the house and many happy games of hideandseek were played there in all the nooks and crannies
 ln , while i was away at scout camp, my family moved into Rosemary Cottage
 They did, however, let me know where they had moved to! Rosemary Cottage adequately accommodated my parents and us six children
 It took some getting used to the low beams, and the fact that it never stopped creaking and making strange sounds, particularly at night
 There is not a single rightangled wall, ceiling, door or window in the whole of Rosemary Cottage   and pieces were cut off the tops of doors and added to the bottom to make them fit
 It had a mischievous poltergeist, which would make thi
ngs disappear and reappear in the most obvious of piaces, and the family dogs would regularly be seen staring into the corners of rooms, their hackles up and lowgrowling
 On one occasion, an army friend came round and would not believe my stories about the poltergeist
 While we were talking, half of his pint of beer had disappeared from his glass when we looked back at it
 This said, we were never put in fear by our extra resident
  it has to be said that when we look back on life, we often do so through rosetinted spectacles and we find humour in what, at the sme, was possibly difficult to deal with
 i joined the Army in  as a musician in HM Life Guards Band, part of the Household Cavalry, and served until 
 I was fifteen years old when i went to The Guards Depot in Pirbright, Surrey
 I was in a man's world but it has to be understood that, at this time, I was five foot tall, blond haired, blueeyed, had a wellspoken soprano voice and a slight lisp
 Life was going to be a challenge and i ensured that I slept with my back to the wall every night
 My accommodation was on the third floor of the Junior Musicians Wing
 Unfortunately, all the issued clothes were designed for soldiers of six foot in height, so i rattled around inside my green denims, which hung off me loosely
 One night, I was larking about with the trained soldier in charge of our wing, and i threatened to throw his towel out of the window
 He said that if I did so, then I would follow
 Not believing that he meant it, i threw the towel out
 Next thing I knew, I was hanging upside down outside the window, third floor up from the ground, and I was rapidly slipping out of my illfitting denims
 it was only my large boots that stopped me completely sliding out of the trained soldier's grip as he tried to haul me back inside
 Not long after this, we were practicing marching in band   formation
 Somehow, I got out of step with the others and was out of alignment with the rest of my rank
 The Drum Major then proceeded to advise me of my errors in no uncertain terms
 When he had finished, he asked me if I understood the error of my ways
 Now, for the life of me, I don't know why I did it, but I gave him my best smile
 I told him I had taken on board what he had yelled at me and gave him a cheeky wink
 All hell broke loose! He apparently took exception to being winked at by a soldier in his ranks and exploded with a string of expletives that cannot be printed here
 Needless to say, he was not impressed
 It has to be said that in the early days of my training, I was just not quite getting the hang of the army lark!  Every Saturday morning, the whole of the Junior Guards Depot assembled on the Drill Square to practice marching
 One particularly bitter winter's morning, I had been delayed, cleaning my kit for the parade, and had not had time to go to breakfast
 Before going on parade, you should always ensure you have food inside you, or you are likely to faint
 This is particularly important if it is hot or very cold weather
 Realising this and having no time to get a breakfast, I reasoned that if I scoffed half a box of Jaffa Cakes, this would probably suffice: wrong! We got on parade, but the weather was so extremely cold, even the valves on our instruments froze
 Gradually, this horrible feing of dizziness and nausea came over me
 Now, it has to be understood that the Drill Square is hallowed ground in the army and must be treated with due respect and reverence
 It is always kept immaculately clean
  Well, the combination of the cold and the Jaffa Cakes took its toll on me and I proceeded to be sick onto the Drill Square
 This was not a wise thing to do
  Long after the parade had finished, I could be seen on my hands and knees with a bucket and scrubbing brush
 The clear instructions I had been given by the Regimental Sergeant Major were that, when he returned to inspect the offending area, it should be good and clean enough for him to eat his dinner off
  At least I didn't have to do it with my toothbrush! Another valuable life lesson was learnt that the army marches on its stomach  but not on its contents on the ground!  The following summer, we gave a concert to entertain the Guards Depot and one of the pieces consisted of Sea Shanties
 Yes, you've guessed it
 Imagine my humiliation as there I was, dressed up on stage as a Cabin Boy, trilling my Soprano heart out in front of hundreds of tough guy soldiers
  For weeks afterwards, everywhere I went, there were wolf whistles
 Thankfully, soon after this, my voice broke and I grew ten inches over the space of a year
  Time moved on and, having attained the ripe old age of seventeen, I moved onto Regular Man Service
 I left the Junior Guards Depot behind to start the next chapter in my dubious service to Queen and Country
    In September , I enlisted in the Army and became a part of HM Life Guards Mounted Band
 Having served for two years on Boy Service at the Guards Depot in Pirbright, Surrey, I moved onto Man Service and began a new chapter in my life
 From  to , i was at Kneller Hall School of Army Music
 During the springtime of , we were all assembled in the Concert Hall for a practice
 Above us, outside on the flat roof, there were workmen busy carrying out retarring and maintenance work
  When the band was not playing, there were some odd creaks and groans to be heard coming from the roof
 Suddenly, with a loud bang, the ceiling collapsed and a workman, with his tar machine, came tumbling down from above
 I faced a quick decision
 Should I run towards the walls  which were coming inwards  or should I shelter under my chair? I chose to run towards the walls and watched as a beam descended from the ceiling and crushed my vacated chair flat
  We all struggled out of the hall for a roll call to find that there had only been a few minor injuries among us, which included the workman who had come through the roof
 We definitely brought the house down that day! Up to the middle of the , I was part of the State Trumpet Fanfare Team, and we carried out engagements both on foot and mounted on our horses across Great Britain and on the Continent
 Our uniform consisted of a metal ornate helmet with a long horsehaired plume hanging from the top, red tunic with a white cross belt and waist belt, tight black trousers and spurred boots
  On one occasion, we had carried out a fanfare at the very posh Cafe Royal Hotel in London from a closedin balcony above the audience
 Having finished, we went off to change
 A message was then sent to us that another fanfare was required promptly, so we charged back onto the balcony and blew another fanfare
 What the bigwigs below did not know was that all of us were trouserless behind the balcony but looking very grand from the waist up
  At the Colchester Tattoo, this time we were all mounted on our horses for the final dress rehearsal and all the participants in the Tattoo were assembled in the arena
 We blew our opening fanfare
 What we did not know was that there was a flyover by three Harrier Jets as we finished
 Needless to say, the jets flying over startled the horses which shot off in all directions, trampling over the assembled masses in the Arena and leaving the area looking like Custer's Last Stand
  Occasionally, we carried out corporate events
 At one in Inverness for a wellknown boiler manufacturer, Henry Cooper came into the room carrying a boiler on his shoulders, the slogan being 'Heavy Weight Champion of the World'
 There we were in all our finery, with our white horsehair plumes hanging down
 We blew the fanfare as he made his way to the stage
 For the opening remark of his speech, he turned towards us and said 'In years gone by, i was surrounded by blondhaired beauties, but look what I have been reduced to now!'   When people start to talk about Football, I like to casually drop into the conversation that i have played at Wembley
 People that know me are in no doubt that it wasn't as a footballer! I was taking part in the Wembley Pageant in Wembley Stadium, and was again mounted on my horse, blowing a fanfare
 The Fanfare Team regularly played tricks on each other, and this day turned out to be no exception
  The Fanfare Trumpet had a goldthread inlaid banner and, hanging down on each leading edge, there were coloured cords with tassels on the end
 We raised our trumpets for the fanfare
 As it started, no matter how hard I blew, hardly any sound was coming out
 What I hadn't realised was that the trumpeter next to me had shoved one of the tassels up the bellend of my trumpet
 I blew harder and suddenly the tassel flew out of the end of my trumpet, which then emitted a loud blare of sound that any elephant would have been justly proud of
 Luckily, as there were eight trumpeters, it was impossible for the audience to tell who the noisy offender was but I quietly plotted my revenge for another day
  There was one occasion, however, when blowing a fanfare did me an unexpected favour
   Back in the Seventies at the cinema, the main feature was always accompanied by a Path News feature
   I had taken my verynew girlfriend to watch the film Jaws'
 I thought it would make her jump in places and this would be a perfect opportunity for me to put a protective arm around her
 (You have to watch young lads, they can be very devious)
  As we watched the Path News, suddenly up onto the silver screen came a closeup of me, on my horse, at the Royal Windsor Horse Show blowing a fanfare for the Queen's arrival
 Now, this was a result on two fronts
 Firstly, my new girlfriend jumped to her feet and yelled out 'That's my boyfriend,' clearly establishing how she felt about me and, secondly, I could now add starring on the silver screen to my repertoire of chatup lines! As I have said before, sometimes we carried out corporate events
 One such occasion was at the Dorchester Hotel in London
 This was for a Jewish bar mitzvah
 Bizarrely, there was a young lioness in a cage in the foyer of the hotel as part of the ceremony
 After everyone had arrived, we had played the fanfare and the event was underway, I returned to the foyer for another look at the lioness
 i was still dressed in my red tunic
 As the lioness was no longer needed, the owners were moving her from the show cage into the tunnel leading to their travel vehicle
  Just how it happened, i don't know, but suddenly the lioness had escaped and was wandering around the foyer
 I hid behind an ornate pillar, mindful of the fact that in my red tunic, I probably looked like a very tasty piece of juicy meat to the lioness
 Thankfully, the handler grabbed the lioness and she went off down the tunnel to her travel vehicle while the colour gradually returned to my cheeks
 They say 'curiosity killed the cat,' but my fear was that the proverb would be reversed! On another occasion, we were at Brands Hatch
 The winner of the race stood on the rostrum in front of us
 We blew the   fanfare for the presentation and remained static while he opened the champagne
 in the finest racing tradition, he sprayed the champagne
 He then turned towards us and squirted the champagne all over us, soaking our uniforms
 Needless to say, i knew what i wanted to do with my trumpet, banner, bellend and all!  Just some of the memories from many years ago that are still so clear and vivid in my mind, as if it was all yesterday
 it is so frustrating that the things that have happened to me in more recent times have become so blurred and hard to recall
 However, i will continue to stubbornly fight the good fight with dementia
 it isn't about to win yet!  I'll never forget the time when i was a Village Policeman near Sevenoaks in 
 I was living in the Police House and my son was about six months old
 My sister came to stay over a weekend with her nine month old baby daughter, her husband and their dog
 All was peace and quiet, until am on the Sunday morning, when the doorbell went
 There then followed a chain reaction
 The doorbell sounding caused both my dog and my sister's dog to start barking furiously
 This woke the two babies who, at the top of their lungs, like banshees from hell, both started to scream the house down
 Dutifully, the young mothers rose from their beds to attend to and pacify their upset offspring
 Now, new fathers are famously pretty good at sleeping through their newborn's cries in the middle of the night but, with the added backinggroup chorus provided by the dogs, this was not to be the case
 The whole household was now awake
 Having quickly thrown some clothes on, i dashed to the front door to attend to what must be a Very important Emergency to wake us all in the middle of the night
 There stood a young mother on my doorstep, with a babe in arms swaddled tightly against the cold night air
 Whatever it is that has happened, it must very serious for them both to be out on a night like this, i mused
 i asked the young woman what had occurred, adrenaline mounting and ready to spring into action
   She then proceeded to tell me the shocking story in all its gory detail
 There was a fox at the end of her garden that was howling, keeping her baby awake
 What did i suggest she should do? Moments passed with complete silence from me while i struggled to phrase a suitable, polite response, far from what I really thought she should go and do!   Back in the early s, i trained as a driving instructor
 To say the least, life was rarely boring and I never knew just what challenge was round each corner from day to day
 One particular lady that i taught, even now, brings a smile to my face when i recall her eccentricity, and the journey that we had together to enable her to successfully obtain a Full Driving Licence
 She had taken some lessons before meeting me, but said she was changing her instructor because the previous one didn't seem to have a sense of humour
 This should have warned me as to what was to come
 Now, as was normal practice, on the roof of my car i had a name board with Lplates on, which was placed behind the Sunroof, so that it could be clearly visible
 She settled herself into the car and adjusted the rear view mirror
 She then burst into laughter and exclaimed that she could see i had a sense of humour, and that what i had done was a very funny trick to play
  I was puzzled and asked her what she meant
 She replied that i had put the name board across the back window so she couldn't see out
 I then realised what she had done: when she adjusted the rear view mirror, she had tilted it so high that it was giving a view up through the sunroof towards the sky, with the roofboard blocking her view!  A few weeks later, on another lesson, we were approaching a crossroads, where we were going to turn right, The mirrors were    checked correctly, the right indicator was applied and the correct position was taken up in the road, ready to turn right
 All was going fine, text book stuff
 She looked into the junction to the right: all was clear to turn, and i naturally assumed we would turn right
  Without any warning, she suddenly steered to the left, and attempted to turn into the road, on the left! I whipped my head round, at a speed likely to cause whiplash,to check that there were no vehicles passing on our inside, but  thankfully  there was nothing there
 We pulled over and i explained the error of her ways while my heartbeat calmed back down to a normal rate
 It just goes to show that if you assume anything, it could make an ASS of U and ME
  As the course of the lessons progressed over the weeks, various bizarre things occurred, just a couple of which I'll share here
 We had reached the point for me to teach the 'Reverse Around a Left Corner' manoeuvre
 We had stopped, and were getting ready to begin the reversing
 I advised her that she needed to get into a position where she could have a good view out of the back window
 There was a click of her seatbelt being released and, next thing I knew, she was kneeling on her seat
 looking out of the back window
 Through a stifled laugh, i asked her how she was going to reach the pedals and also steer
 It was all too much when she replied that she would have to stretch a bit, and we both descended into fits of uncontrolled laughter, with tears rolling down our cheeks!  On another occasion, we were going to carry out the 'Turn in the Road' exercise, commonly known as the threepointturn
 The idea is to turn the car around to face the opposite direction, by using the full width of the road
 We had carried out the first part and driven forward across the road
 We were now doing the second part, with us reversing across the width of the road
 As we did so, she said she could no longer see the kerb behind us and I advised her that she could look out of the driver's side window to enable her to see the kerb
  There then followed a loud thump and she started to rub her forehead and i could see a grease mark on the driver's window
 I advised her that it was probably best to open the window first!  The day before the Driving Test had arrived
 She said that she was nervous, which was understandable, but would it be alright if she wore her lucky troll? I said it would, knowing that it would help her feel less on edge
  The following morning, I picked her up for her test
 She came out of her house and got into the car: she had six small, multicolouredhair trolls, pinned down the front of her jumper like military buttons
 Around her neck, on a leather bootlace, she had a troll about six inches tall with bright purple DayGlo hair
  I asked her, through gritted teeth to stop me laughing, whether she really needed all the trolls, but she insisted she needed all the luck that they would bring
 I was inclined to agree with her
 We arrived at the Test Centre and took our seats in the Waiting Room
 I shall never forget the look on the female Driving   Examiner's face when she entered the room, called out my pupil's name and beheld this bizarre apparition in front of her
  I tried, with all my selfcontrol, to not laugh out loud when i saw the Examiner's face turn from initial shock, through to a smile and then the Examiner left the room, with her shoulders starting to shake as she descended into laughter
 The Examiner came back into the room a moment or two later, with watery eyes from laughing and, having got herself back under control, proceeded off on test with my pupil
  When they got back, the lady had passed her test and the Examiner walked passed me with the parting comment that seeing my pupil dressed up like that had been the best thing that had happened to her in years
  Bella: The Black Beauty We had always wanted a German Shepherd dog
 When the children were small, we tried out a Rescue Alsatian that had been mistreated, but it kept nipping them all the time and we felt it could not be trusted
 Sadly, we had to give it back
  Some twelve years ago, we purchased a twelve week old GermanBelgium Shepherd cross puppy
 Her mother was blackhaired and the father was whitehaired
 As she grew, she had the black coat of her mother, with a white under carriage from her father and, bizarrely, browntanned legs
  She was never going to win a prize at Crufts but she was beautiful to us
  Dogs take on the nature and demeanour of the household they live in, and Bella was no exception
 She was just a big old softy and loved to spend her time lying down with her legs in the air, her tummy all exposed
 However, if somebody knocked the door, she assumed the role of family protector, barking and growling in a deep voice, pretending for all the world that she was going to eat the caller whole!  She had endless energy for a game of chase the ball or stick, and her big brown eyes looked so disappointed when her staminadepleted thrower decided to stop
  She was always pleased to see us, even if we had only been out of the house for five minutes
 She would come bounding up, her eyes all bright and her bushy tail wagging so hard, that she nearly turned herself insideout with excitement
   She was always inquisitive as to what we were doing and would follow us from room to room to ensure that she didn't miss out on what was going on
 She regarded the lawn mower as a threat and would be ciose beside me when I went to the shed to get it out
 When the electric motor was started, she would bark at the mower and bite its wheels initially, in a protective manner, to show it who was boss
  She was accepting when my daughter's cat became a permanent resident in the household and would cuddle up lovingiy with it but when it was in the garden she would chase after it playfully, barking madly, with no real intention of catching it
 When my daughterinlaw's young Guide Dog was introduced into the household, she welcomed her in but definitely kept the young whippersnapper in her place, on occasions, to show her who was The Boss
  In October , she passed away and we lost a loving, loyal member of our family  but her memory lives eternally within our hearts and souls
   My wedding ring is made of bright gold, and is one of a pair that my wife and I wear
 It was perfectly round thirtysix years ago, but has now mouided to the shape of my finger
 On the outer surface, there was a 'treebark effect
 This has now been virtually smoothed away with the years of constantly being on my finger
 However, the love that it signifies has not similarly diminished or worn away with time
  The love and the gold ring over the years, both have withstood the rough and tumble that life can inflict, to emerge still shining out like a beacon in the night
  Like the gold ring, my wife and i have moulded and adapted so that we still remain a perfect fit for each other
  Like the gold ring, our love continues endlessly and is there for all to see
 Although of no great financial value, in terms of emotional value, it is priceless
     The last five years have certainly caused me to view my life in a very different way and learn to live for  and in  the moment
 Life will always throw challenges at us but, as long as we get up and fight one more time, we are not beaten
 Let me explain
 At the age of eleven, I started to learn to play the trumpet and subsequently joined the army as a musician in HM Lifeguards' Band
 On leaving the army, i became a police officer in the Kent Police, and was a founder member of the Kent Police Band
 I was able to continue my playing, but now played Tenor Horn
   In , I had two heart attacks which hospitalised me, and a further heart attack in 
 I am now fitted with seven stents
 i was told by my doctors to stop playing as this appeared to be putting an undue strain on my heart
 I followed the advice but I desperately missed playing, something I had done for over fortyfour years
   As I recovered from the third heart attack, I contracted Shingles, as my immune system was low
 This manifested itself mainly on my face and forehead
 Luckily, although my eyes were infected, no permanent damage was caused to my sight
   Over the next couple of years, a level of tiredness and exhaustion set in like i had never known before
 I was eventually diagnosed with ME
 (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) which was a result of the Shingles virus
   I had reached a crossroads in my life
 I could give in, submit and deteriorate or I could fight back
 I decided firmly in my mind to rise to, and overcome this challenge
 The battle was not done yet, and i would emerge the victor!  During , it became increasingly apparent to my family, my work colleagues and to me that a change was occurring
  i was starting to mix up my words, i was getting confused with regard to things that had happened in the recent past, and I appeared to be just becoming vague when in conversation
  At the time, i was employed as a Driving Examiner
 The nature of my work during the driving test of candidates required me to remember what, when and where things had happened in order to debrief the test and then accurately write up the report afterwards
 i noticed that this was becoming increasingly hard for me to do, and needed far greater and more intense concentration
  I made the first of a series of visits to my doctor's practice
 I was given the standard dementia test which I appeared to have no problem with
  Dementia was ruled out as being the problem
   it was suggested that I might be suffering from depression
 Having been clinically depressed and having had a nervous breakdown in , i knew that how i was feeling now had nothing to do with depression
  Over that year, i made a series of visits to the GP
 My symptoms were getting slowly worse with no remedy being found
 i visited another G
P
 within the practice
 He again carried out the standard dementia test, which again did not flag up dementia problems
 The G
P
 said that certain types of dementia did not   show up using the standard test and, this time, a referral was made for me to attend the local Memory Clinic
  it had now become impossible for me to continue working, and although i made two attempts to go back to work, both times i only managed a couple of days before my manager, seeing that i was not coping, suggested that i return to 'sick' status
  i subsequently attended the Memory Clinic where a series of in depth tests were carried out
 in December, , as a result of these tests, i was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia'
  it was clear that there was a problem with regard to my executive functioning
 This was the ability to put things correctly, sequentially, when given in a random order
 i also had various scans but these did not show up any significant abnormalities
 i was assured that this was not unusual as, in ten to fifteen per cent of cases of frontotemporal dementia, it did not show up on the scans
   As a result of the diagnosis and there being no cure, i was forced to retire from work
   Although it is never good to get a diagnosis of dementia, it was a great relief to finally establish the cause of the challenges that i was having in everyday functioning
 i was now able to explain to family and friends the reasons why my demeanour and behaviour was sometimes different from the person they all knew well
  The overall effect that my frontotemporal dementia has on me can be summed up in the famous Morecombe and Wise sketch with Andre Previn, where Eric Morecombe said  i have now done two courses of Cognitive Stimulation Therapy
 The first was in a group (We called ourselves the 'Happy Wanderers which was quite apt) and the second course was on a onetoone basis, and i have also had Speech Therapy
 These treatments have allowed me to expand on the coping strategies that i have put in place to help me cope with my daily challenges
  On conclusion of the Cognitive Stimulation Therapy, i joined the ForgetMeNots group
 i have found being part of this group to be very stimulating  it is good to exchange thoughts and views with my peers on numerous subjects surrounding dementia and coping mechanisms
  Since joining the group, i have been involved in six projects and there are a number in the near future
 Recently, the ForgetMeNots have been involved in a Life Writing project which is how this book came about
 Members of the group have been featured on the radio talking about the book and their very diverse experiences of life's twists and turns
  The group certainly gets us out and about! There are about twenty of us in The ForgetMeNots and we are greatly supported and aided by psychology students
  i find this group very stimulating and the feeling of friendship and community goes a long way to reassure all our group members that they are not alone in the strange, and sometimes confusing, world of dementia
  it is now very difficult for me to put things in a correct sequence, even down to the order of the letters in the alphabet,   which is something learnt at an early age
   As a result of my diagnosis, I decided to live life to the full and went back to playing my Tenor Horn
 Most weekends I can be found on a bandstand somewhere in Kent, or further afield
 it has become increasingly difficult to read the music correctly and, like words, it is now harder to get the information off the page in the correct order and sequence
 This applies to all aspects of my thinking process where a correct sequence of events is required
  It is my belief that, when life throws challenges at us, we should face them headon and fight back
 i have adopted the daily mantra of in the famous words of Winston Churchill:  Chris R For the many happy and loving years together and hopefully many more, to my wife, Andrea Ryanm   
i was apprehensive when joining the life writing group: i didn't  think it would be my thing  how wrong could i be?  On the first day Liz, our teacher, gave out some words for us  to think about
 It's amazing, what comes into your head
 One of  the words she said was 'Swimming Badges'
 i thought, swimming  badges? What could i write about those? Then, from nowhere,  came:   This was something that happened to me over fifty years ago
 These words sparked memories in my head
 From then on, i was hooked
 i have loved it, and would recommend it to anyone with or without dementia
 it was very stimulating
    My dementia
 Where do I start? About four years ago in , my wife said she started to notice i was doing strange things, little things, like starting one thing and going onto something else before finishing the last job, forgetting where I put stuff  silly things at the time that were put down to getting older, and that old saying, 'Oh, we all do that'
 What an annoying saying that turned out to be! After she kept saying that she would be worried if it were her, i went to the doctors, but my problems were blamed on my medication for my other ailments, like diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis and depression
 So, home I went to explain what the doctor said, and to say, don't worry  I'm okay
 About four months later I'm back there again
 Same answer, Im okay
 Three months later i took my wife with me and she told the doctor about what I had been doing and saying, and, bingo! I get a referral to the assessment, which threw up a few problems, so i was referred to a consultant psychologist for more tests
 I had a CT scan, an MRI scan, both of which didn't show anything abnormal, but my consultant was sure I had something wrong, and i was sent for a SPECT scan
 This showed an abnormality, and from there, after more tests, i was given a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia
 What a relief this was for me and my wife! Now we had a name for what was wrong with me, and we could now move on   with our lives
 We thought we would just jog along as normal, but as we know, that's not what happens
 i have gotten worse, and it has become much harder for my wife
 Our roles are reversing
 i used to do everything: banking, bills, paperwork, and the daytoday organising of things
 it's like i have stepped back and she has stepped forward
 Also, now i don't like noise, confrontation, crowds  i just want a quiet life
 Another problem is that I say what i see, and it doesn't matter where we are  I will just say it whereas before I might think it and say nothing
 Now, i just say it, and that can be very embarrassing for my wife
 Not me, because I don't realise that Ive said anything wrong
 We tell everyone what I have and find that helpful
 The only problem with this is, (here's that saying again), 'Oh I do that', 'We all do that '
 No, you don't, unless you have a diagnosis of dementia
 Yes, everybody does forget things as you get older, but with dementia it is so much more than that, not just forgetting a few things or putting the milk in the microwave by mistake
 As my wife says, have a day in her life and then you'll see what really goes on
 We have been very lucky with the support we have received from the carers' service, the mental health team, the Dover Lifeboat old boys, and the ForgetMeNots
 This group has been a great support to me
 its run by people with different dementias
    We have two consultant psychologists, and some psychology students, on hand to help with the paperwork and organising different meetings and events for us to attend, but the meetings are run by us
 I would not have been writing this book if it were not for them, and i wouldn't have spoken at dementia conferences
 Were it not for them, I wouldn't have sat on interview panels
 If it were not for them, i would not have spoken at memory clinics for newly diagnosed people with dementia, telling them what they can do, and what help is available for them, like driving tests, clubs to join, Carers' Society for their partners and so on
 There is a lot out there for us, and we're getting more and more as people become more aware of dementia
 This group has given me a purpose
 There is life after diagnosis you just have to adjust to What you can do
 Your whole lifestyle changes
 You are lucky if you have good family and friends around you
 Every day is different, but it's like that in real life, so try to enjoy it
   I moved to Albany Place in , when i was twenty three years old
 The house was over  years old
 it had one bedroom but was very spacious
 It had a spiral staircase in the middle of the lounge made from a tree trunk, with pine steps, and rope handrails
 Our house in those days, you could leave your door open all day without worrying about someone coming in
 The whole street was like this, all looking out for one another
 There was an old graveyard at the back of the house going up to the historic moats
 We used to play with the kids in the street, sliding down on bits of cardboard and tin down the hills
 if any animal died, they used to come to me
 I think I was the animal undertaker! On bonfire night we used to have a great big fire for the kids (and us)
 There were lots of fireworks, hotdogs, burgers, sandwiches, sweets and a lot of drink
 What great times, and great memories
 Sadly, those times are gone forever
       Ill never forget the time i was called out on the lifeboat
 it was at about : on the morning of the th October, 
 Our bleepers didn't go off, but luckily i heard the maroons go off
 At that time the wind was blowing at about seventy miles per hour,  and gusting at a hundred
  I can always remember, as i was pulling away in my car, our neighbour Debbie came out and said to my wife, 'You're not letting  him go, are you?' She said 'I can't stop him, it's what he does
 '  Then, looking up, there was a six by six foot fence panel  floating above the house opposite
   'That's strange', i thought, still half asleep, and went on my  way to the lifeboat
    All the way there i was getting battered by flying debris
  When I got to the boat, i was the last of our seven crew to get  arrive
 I was still thinking it wasn't too bad, just blowing a bit
 But once i got aboard, i went into the cabin, and Geoff, a school  teacher and our radio operator, had all his life saving gear on
  I said,  'Why have you got all that on?'  He said 'That's bloody rough out there!'  That's the first time I had ever seen Geoff with all his gear on
  He was right it was rough
 We had been called out to the ferry Hengist, but she had run aground off of Folkestone and seemed  to be okay
 it was the other one that was our job now
 Our coxswain, Roy, a garage owner and lifeboat second    Coxswain mechanic, said 'The other one?' 'Yes a small ship called the Sumnia, the Coastguard said
 She was getting blown towards Dover by the weather, she had her anchors out but nothing would hold her in those seas
 We let go and tried to leave the berth, but there was a rope around our propeller, stopping us dead
 From somewhere we had two divers go into the water to try to free the rope
 They did what they could but we had to go, as the ship was nearly at the harbour entrance
 We set off again, and this time we managed to get off the berth
 The wind was now OOmph constant
 We could not see a thing going past the Prince of Wales pier, just metres away: nothing
 There was lots of stuff in the water, a fuel bowser that had been blown off the quay, went floating off with lots of other debris
 Then, out of the spray and spume we saw her
 She was getting battered against the breakwater, rising as high as the lighthouse
 We realised that there were two men on the bow, so we tried to get in as close as possible so we could get them off
 Eric, a Royal National Lifeboat Institution employee, and myself, went up to our bow and shouted to them, 'JUMP! But would you in those seas? Luckily for them and us, a huge wave came over and washed them off into the boiling sea
 Dom, a publican, and Eric managed to get them out of the sea and onto the lifeboat
 Then Robert, a policeman, and i got them into the cabin with Geoff
 They didn't seem to have any injuries at that time
   Then we swung around the outside of the Sumnia, looking for more survivors
 it was too rough to get close to her as she was gradually breaking up
 i remember looking back and seeing blue and white sashes as she finally broke in half and sank
 We turned to sea to get a better position to navigate down the back of the breakwater, but we encountered a massive wave which we managed to climb, but felt off the top of
 it was about seventy feet high
 Our coxswain was badly injured by this and the lifeboat nearly capsized, but she managed to right herself just in time before the next big one came
 The rest of us were quite wet from being underwater for most of the time
 Then a call came from port control, saying that they thought they could see a lifejacket floating in the eastern entrance of the harbour
 We steamed down the outside of the harbour to the entrance
 i shouted up to Mick, a train driver who was on the flying bridge with Roy there was something in the water on our starboard side
 i thought it was one of the missing crew, but he said that it was a lump of wood
 To this day i still wonder if it was the missing captain
 This is where we nearly went over again, but the coxswain did us proud and got us to where the lifejacket was
 At first we thought it was just a jacket, but on pulling it up there was a man underneath
 We got him aboard but he was lifeless
 Roy shouted down,  'Get working on him! ' We got him down to the aft cabin where two of us worked on him
 in the and Robert kicked him in the stomach, and he started breathing again
   By now we were heading back to the berth to get the casualties off
 After this we went back out, as there were stilt two men missing
 After about twenty minutes, our coxswain was feeling bad so we had to get him back to shore
 Once in, he was taken to hospital where it turned out that, after coming off of that wave, he had burst a blood vessel at the back of his heart
 it turned out that of the last two men missing, one, the Captain, was never found, and the other, the Chief Ofscer, was found dead on top of the breakwater the next day by the RAF helicopter
 The top wind speed was mph before the machine broke at Dover Coastguard station, and as we know this day is now remembered as  'The Hurricane of '
 We were all awarded RNLl medals for this job, which were presented to us by Princess Alexandra at the Festival Hall in London
 The crew of that night were: Roy, who is now Honorary Secretary at Dover Lifeboat
 Mick Abbott, who Im afraid to say died a few years ago
 Geoff, who now lives in Perth, Australia
 Dom, who now lives in Spain
 Eric, who now lives in New Zealand
 Dave Moore, RNLl shore crew Robert and myself, who still live in Dover
 Im still involved with the Dover Lifeboat
 We sort money we get from the liners that call here, especially Fred Olsen's who are    very good to us, and also the Ferry companies at Dover, where again, PO are also   Going to sea would be a big change that happened to me
 My first foreign port of call was Bermuda, then Nassau, Jamaica, then other Caribbean islands before going through the Panama Canal and down the West coast of South America
 You can't imagine the difference of Dover to all of these exotic places
 At sixteen years old it was amazing
 The world would never look the same again
 I had many adventures at sea
 it was incredible to see all these different countries  Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, all through the Mediterranean, South America, and many more, and i enjoyed every minute of it
 But the main change in my life was meeting Andrea, my wife, for the first time
 I was moving house to the same street she was in
 She was sitting on her doorstep having a quiet cup of tea
 i was in my friend's van moving stuff to my house
 i shouted out,   ' Ill be down in a minute, put the kettle on! i knew how to woo women! It went from there
 I had to do a bit of chasing but i got there in the end
 One day, i was walking up the road with a bunch of daffodils in my hand and there were some of my mates up the road
 They shouted, 'Look who's got flowers!' i said, 'They're not flowers, they're sweets', and i bit the tops off and ate them
 If it hadn't been for Andrea, i don't know where i would have    been now
 dead, probably
 i had a wild lifestyle at sea, getting up to ail sorts
 l took on three children, Mark, Tara and Jay, and then we had Ben together
 They are all my children, all treated the same, and we have had a wonderful life together
 Andrea and i have never argued (as she is always right)
 Joking aside, we just haven't
 My first love was the sea, but Andrea is my main love, and long may it continue
 I have always looked after her and the family, but now that's changing, and they are having to look after me
  in , i was acting Quartermaster (steering the ship) on the Townsend Thoresen ship, the European Trader
 She was a freight vessel
 We were on our way back to Dover from Zeebrugge
 i was taking my break down in the mess room, when i got a call from the bridge to come back up, as there was something going on in the Channel i should know about
 When I got on the bridge, the chief mate called me over to a conversation going on on the VHF radio
 i heard the name of my fishing boat, the AnnaMarie, being mentioned and another local boat called the BellaRye
 Then I heard the Dover Lifeboat calling my boat up
 All kinds of things went through my head, I couldn't think what could have happened
 I called my boat to find out what was going on
 My mate Bob came on to say that apparently the BellaRye was taking in water and my boat went to their assistance, but when they were nearly there my boat blew a liner, which, in modern terms, meant that the piston stopped working, so they were dead in the water
 All of this was happening just on the shipping lane about six miles out of Dover, so as a last resort they called the lifeboat, much to the disgust of three of the lads aboard that day, which i will come to later
 The lifeboat was on its way to the scene
 Upon getting to the sinking boat, the BellaRye, they put a salvage pump aboard and started getting the water down and trying to fix the leak
 After stabilising the boat, they towed her to where my boat was, to take    a line so they could tow her as well
 This is where the coxswain of the lifeboat, Tony Hawkins, got the shock of his life, as there, on my boat, were three of his regular crew, who hadn't told him they were going fishing that day and wouldn't be available for any lifeboat shouts, and with me at work as well he was four men down on his crew straight away
 The procedure is to take the names of the people you rescue for the RNLI records, so there was my mate Bob Duffield, Vic Naylor an old fishing friend, then Micky Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy
 Their real names were Geoff Buckland, radio operator on the lifeboat and two crew members Mick Abbott and Dave Austin
 This was very embarrassing for them, as you can imagine they took a lot of stick for ages, plus it made the local press: 'Lifeboat crew rescued by their lifeboat' was the headline
 We still have the cutting today
 Im just glad i wasn't there as I would have had to have been Pluto that day
   Early one July morning in  i got a call from the coastguard saying a plane had come down in the English Channel, and did i wanted to go out and get it? i thought, why hasn't the lifeboat gone to it? The reason was because it was a Blriot plane ditched, the pilot was rescued, and the down draft from the helicopter sank the plane, so that as they sew away it appeared she had sunk without a trace
 However, because she was made of wood, her tail fin came up above the water
 I made my way down to my boat and proceeded to go out to her last reported sighting near the South Goodwin Lightship
 The sea was flat calm a beautiful day for plane hunting, I thought
 On my way I saw a yacht coming my way, so i went over to them and asked if they'd seen a plane floating about
 Well, you can guess the answer I got back: they thought i was mad
 Off i went on my search
 Near the lightship I saw something sticking out of the water
 Yes, it was the Blriot, so I went sternto so I could try to get a rope on her
 I managed to put the rope through the tail section
 Then, i tried to pull her aboard my boat, without much success, because the weight of the engine was keeping her down by the front of the plane
 I secured it as best i could and started to head for Dover
 i had kept the coastguard informed of what was happening, and asked if the ferries would give me a wide berth as i didn't want    their wash breaking the plane in half
 But then, all of a sudden, i had helicopters above from the news stations, a local boat with the owner of the Bleriot on board, and other craft with film crews on
 There i was, plodding along, quite happy, singing,  Im Popeye the Sailor Man,' when all hell breaks loose
 One of the owner's people came up behind me on a launch and jumped into the sea next to the plane
 He was trying to cut the wings off, they said it didn't matter about those, it was the original engine and body that mattered
 i wasn't having any of that and told them to keep away and increased my speed a bit
 Then, the owner, Mr Blriot, who was on the harbour launch came closer and wanted me to pass my rope over so they could get her on board their boat, as they had more manpower and didn't want her to get damaged
 As we were just off the port i agreed to do this (it was his plane)
 Anyway, they couldn't get it aboard, so they towed it instead
 Once near the slipway in the harbour, people got in the water and managed to drag it ashore
 There were hundreds of people on the beach by this time because it was on the news channels and on radio
 i went and tied my boat up and made my way to the beach
 I was swamped by the press and the TV wanting to do interviews
 They were all saying 'You are going to be a millionaire!' i wasn't bothered by all that, i just enjoyed going out and finding her and getting her back
   The next day, someone phoned my wife and said 'What's it like to be a millionaire? She said 'I don't know, but Im kicking my hoover to make it work at the moment so I'm not too interested
 ' She put the phone down on them
 We were never millionaires, but we got a nice drink for my four hours' work salvaging the Blriot, and the nice thing was Mr Blriot got his plane back nearly in one piece  and i understand he still has it today
    One week, Liz got us writing list poems
 These are quick and easy  you just make a list! i listed the contents of my pockets
 Surprising, how simple things like this can produce something interesting
  I mentioned in my list poem,  'What's in My Pockets,' my  'little blue card, better than a passport
' i thought I'd better explain
 One morning, i was going on a day trip to France with some of the lifeboat old crew
 We went through both French and English controls, without having to Show my passport, and then again, i didn't show it at the ticket booth
 So, off to the ship we go, ready to sail to France, when i realise don't have my passport with me
 One of the lads said, Are you going back for it?' i said, No, we'll get back in okay
' We had our day out, and got back to the British Control at Calais
 i handed three passports over, but the officer said There are four of you, where's the other passport?' I said i had left mine at home, but i had my dementia card
 He thought i was joking
 i reassured him,  'No, i do have dementia
' He checked the other passports and then called someone up
 We were guided to another office where a man came out and looked at my dementia card, and asked me if i knew where my passport was
 l said, Still in the drawer, at home
' He said, Ok  fill this form in, sign it, and you can go
' How great was that?! The lads were amazed
 Wherever I go, i make sure my little blue card is always with me, as you never know when and where it might come in handy
    it's square and smooth
 it's getting jaded, very jaded
 it has a ship on it and also the Merchant Navy flag, and a Merchant Navy emblem
 it's plastic
 A good friend of mine gave it to me: it's a key ring
 My key ring was given to me by an old seaman friend, who was a  'boy' rating in the Second World War
 He was sunk three times by Uboats
The things he saw and went through were amazing
 The key ring shows the ship SS Athenia
 She was the first ship sunk, within hours of the war starting
 The Uboat U sank her
 By chance, there was a lot of ships about to help, and  people were rescued, but ninetyeight passengers and nineteen crew died
 This was the first of many Merchant Navy losses throughout the war
 Theirs was a very dangerous job
 They kept the country going, bringing in supplies and food
 Also, the Arctic convoys helped the Russians
 There is a Merchant Navy memorial at Aidgate in London, to all the lost seamen
 Speaking of lost seamen, i'd like to recommend a poem recently read, called In Waters Deep,' by Eileen Mahoney
 it means a lot to me, because my granddad's brother, Joseph Ryan, an Able Seaman at the Battle of Jutland, was on HMS invincible in the First World War
 She was sunk on May st  with the loss of   , lives
 Only six men were rescued
 He was drowned and lost at sea, so there was no grave
 My granddad, George Ryan, was on HMS Lion and saw his brother's ship hit and sunk
 For all seamen and fisherman lost at sea, this is a very fitting poem
 Joseph Ryan was one of many who lost their lives in the First World War who was represented by one of the ceramic poppies in the  display at the Tower of London
   In the cabin on my old ship, The Port New Plymouth, i made a double bunk out of a sheet of marine ply
 I got a double mattress off the purser out of a passenger cabin
 I painted the cabin out and stuck some posters up
 I had a small cassette player up on a small shelf, a small wardrobe and two drawers under the bunk
 I never took a lot with me, no matter how long I was going away for
 i only had two sets of gear to wear ashore
 I had a small bathroom cabinet, a little table and a daybed, all very cosy to spend months at sea in, then ready for the good times to be had in New Zealand and Australia
 So many good times  I could write a book! Oh: I am writing a book!  After my diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, i thought we just had to get on with our lives and that's it
 How wrong was I?! After attending some coffee morning groups, which were not for me, i was invited to join the ForgetMeNots group in Canterbury
 This has opened a whole new life for me
 At my first meeting I sat next to Reinhard, my Consultant Psychologist, and said to him, 'Who are all the doctors here? He said Only me and James, everyone else has a form of dementia
 i was amazed as the meeting was being run by all these people
 I thought Keith, who has Alzheimer's, was a doctor, because he was taking notes and was chairman of the meeting
 He knew everything, and everyone else was giving their views about different subjects
 This isn't the view of dementia that the public sees, or in my view, that the government sees
 So now I'm a member of this wonderful group, with so many great people
 We really are a great mix, and we like to get everybody's view
 This is very important as everyone's experience of dementia is different
 I have sat on interview panels for different grades to work with dementia, i have spoken at memory clinics about how i cope with living with dementia, and about what support is available
 Also, i spoke at a conference in Ashford, Kent, with Lewis Slade, a Psychology Undergraduate about living with frontotemporal   dementia
 Later on, we spoke at a psychology conference in Shrewsbury (the  Faculty of the Psychology of Older People Conference), to professors and clinical psychologists, and other people involved in working with dementia
 Our presentation won the award for the best presentation over the two day conference
 I was so proud of Lewis for all the work and help he has put into me, and I know he will always remember that day on his rise to becoming a top psychologist! I have written to the Prime Minister about getting a grant for everyone with a diagnosis of dementia so the government can pay for them to get Lasting Power of Attorney
 This is something that you are told to do, because without it you can have all sorts of problems, with your finances, your wishes and your health
 Who would have thought it! Here is me with a diagnosis of dementia and I'm involved in all of these things
 Now, I know this might sound strange, but there are benefits to having dementia: all the work we are doing for the future for people with dementia, all the great people i have met in our group and at meetings and interviews letting people know about dementia, and that it's not a death sentence, and that there are lots of things out there for you
 We can make a big difference ensuring that the people in power learn from us, to make sure they get it right for the future of dementia
 Also, for the carers there are plenty of groups and organisations to help them as well
 Lastly, things are changing for me, i know it
 Certain things   become more difficult
 Simple things are not so easy anymore, but you have got to do your best to get on with your life as best as you can
 My wife, Andrea, and i thought we would just carry on as normal, but as we now know that is not what happens
 We started on the same path, Andrea is still on that path, but Im on the M: normal slow fast stop let's get off
 That's what it seems like to me
 But, we shall carry on and see where it takes us
      Ill never forget the time I went
to see the neurologist at the hospital on th May 
 The day began normally
 The sun was shining
 The BBC Breakfast weather girl predicted warm sunshine which pleased me as a trip in the sun is always better than in the rain
 Dinner duty back at school awaited me, and it is much less hassle if the children are able to run around outside
 Today, because it was so dry and warm would have the added bonus of them going on the field
 Rosemary and i arrived in good time
 i hadn't been to this hospital before, so i was more nervous about being late, and not finding the right reception area rather than to receive the results of my MRI scan
 Why would I need an MRI scan if i had problems with my balance and ears? i only briefly dwelt upon this question
 i was relieved to be met by a friendly receptionist in a quiet waiting area
 A promising start
 What time is it
 :  my deputy would be standing in for me and conducting the assembly today
 I did chat to her before leaving school last night and we agreed the story and the hymn a story about being positive, and the hymn, well it was One more step around the world I go
' That should go with a bounce as always, the children love that one
 Exactly on time the neurologists nurse calls me in to have my weight and blood pressure checked
 All very routine Im assured
    Back into the waiting room
 Break time back at school now: again, thank goodness for the sunshine
 Thoughts of school were interrupted by 'Mr Oliver, will you please come this way
' i was led accompanied by Rosemary my wife, across the waiting area to a typical doctor's consultation room: square modern paperwork strewn across a table computer screen idling on the corner of a desk NHS files much like the Department for Education equivalents in my office
 And there, centre stage, was the neurologist who until this moment was merely a name on an appointment letter
 in the next few moments this was to change, but not only that, you could say my life was to change
 The consultant asked us to take a seat and ran through a series of questions about my health: why i had gone to my GP a month or so previously, and i explained about the falls, the tiredness, the inability to concentrate, the petite mal type phases recently experienced
 He listened intently to what seemed like a long explanation, but wasn't really
 Then he embarked on a series of what i thought of as silly questions: what month is it, what season, who is the Prime Minister, count back from seventy in sevens all very easy
 Then onto him reading three words and asking me to repeat them  I hadn't a clue, where are we at this moment  can't remember the name of the hospital but I know the town, isn't that good enough? Then the three wordsobjects again  still they didn't register
 This prompted him to pause and turn his, and then our attention to his computer screen
  Well Mr Oliver, i think that the results of your scan and what you have said to me today is consistent with early stages of Alzheimer's Disease
' He went on to say that the GP had referred me for the scan to rule out a brain tumour
 He assured me there was no tumour
 Along with Alzheimer's this was the first time this had been mentioned
 I was speechless
 My wife was speechless
 He sensed this, and went on to explain that this was a suggested diagnosis and lots more tests and scans would be required in order for this to be confirmed
 He then drew two helpful pictures, showing as he described it, a healthy fiftyfour year old brain and then he drew mine based on the scan  he did try and explain the scan to us but it was too difficult to draw sense from it
 The comparisons the drawings illustrated were helpful then, and subsequently as we came to terms with this and tried to explain it to friends and family
 By now i was regaining some sense of the moment and the dialogue which i felt was necessary
 The first question revolved around the subsequent tests and scans, then we moved on to talk about carrying on working, which i wanted to do
 Next we raised the question of our forthcoming, longbooked annual trip to Australia
 We were alarmed by his response to this which was
 not to go
 But everything is planned and paid for! His advice remained the same
 Subsequently, i reflected upon this
 Determined with Rosemary's support to go ahead with the trip, albeit with a slightly   amended itinerary, i wrote to the neurologist to say i felt with us visiting friends and having been many times before the benefits far outweighed any potential risks
 Thankfully, he was kind enough to send a written reply stating that if i felt well enough then I  should go
 It left me though with the thought which I've never forgotten which is, had I taken his advice  as many would have done in that situation we would have missed a wonderful trip which has subsequently been followed by four more trips to South Australia,  our beloved place in the sun
 The sun was still shining as we emerged from the confines of the hospital
 i suggested to Rosemary, 'Let's have a walk on the  beach nearby'  a favourite spot of ours to clear our heads and  take stock   'I'll ring school to get someone to cover my lunch  duty
 '   That's what we did
 i turned to Rosemary the moment we felt the sand under our feet, and i said, 'One door closes and one door will open
' i didn't know which door it would be, but I have  been proved right
   A memory walk Ive taken has allowed me to take time to think and resect in, what with family events, dementia conferences and TV news interviews, has been a very hectic week
 As i write this i have just arrived home from my weekly visit to a local primary school where I hear children aged eight and nine read, and have the thrill of reading their choice of book to them
 i have just removed my iPod, and settled down to write
 Listening to music, especially through an iPod when walking rarely fails to transport me back in time to when either i first heard that song or album, or to a significant event in my life connected to the music
 Or maybe the music provokes a memory which is more tenuously associated altogether
 This morning the music ringing through my ears, and if l'm truthful prompting me to share my singing of (quietly, i might add) with passersby, was that from the movie Les Miserables
 A few days previously my wife and i really enjoyed going to see the movie at the cinema
 Unlike millions of others we haven't seen the show  yet  and went only with an inkling of the story based on the plethora of reviews we have seen on TV recently
 Often the music, the memories and the events of the day thread together and that was certainly the case today
 It was the rousing songs which transported me back in time to when as a student in the , I, like many, thought we could change the world, or at least have a positive impact upon it
 A thread of this remains with me today
    As a student i was quite politically tuned in, and in my fresher week joined the University Labour Society
 I was a moderate voice in a place where Marxists and Trotskyites often shouted loudest
 In  we were frustrated that the political party we had elected had the temerity to try and introduce a series of spending cuts which targeted education
 Do times change, I ask myself? To me, education was crucial, as it had been my escape route from the council estate where I had different aspirations than the work in a factory or office which appeared to be on the cards
 A large group of us, I can't remember the number but probably in the region of sixty to seventy initially, decided to walk into the University administration building armed with our text books and sleeping bags in order to demonstrate our feelings
 The University authorities were sympathetic, after all this was the Socialist Republic of Sheffield at that time
 We didn't quite blockade the doors but were left alone as long as we didn't wreck the place and dispersed after a few days
 Well, we attracted positive media and local attention! The TV filmed us and we had speakers who had escaped from Pinochet's military regime in Chile who came and inspired us with their true stories and songs which reflected their struggle
 Local Labour MP for Heeley in Sheffield, Frank Hooley, came to speak with us
 I remember him saying during a group conversation that I should be going into politics and not teaching: no thanks! Richard Caborn who at the time was on the city council, and later became Sheffield's Euro MP and then MP in Parliament and a minister in Blair's government came to lend his support
 A   student friend who, unlike me, chose politics over teaching, later became his agent
 After about a week, with numbers dwindling after the initial flood of enthusiasm to a core of about twenty, the demo concluded with a rousing finale as a coachload of us joined the national campaign in marching through London to demand that the Government listened and changed direction
 Walking along the Ashford Road today with the rousing Les Mis', Im transported back to that march
 Whilst I Dreamed a Dream is one of my favourite songs from the film, the ones which most stir my emotions and transport me back in time to our student protest, whilst allowing me to sing along either in my head or if no one is around more vocally, are Red and Black, One More Day and probably most emotive Bring Him Home
 Unlike the Parisians of  portrayed in the film, we did walk home at the end of our protest
 Seldom do I listen to these without a little lump in my throat
 I haven't thought about this period of my life for some time, and when i reflect I think about growing up in the s, which were such interesting times to be influenced as an impressionable youngster
 The  student unrest lit flames in Paris which almost ousted De Gaulle and threatened to sweep across Europe
 The antiVietnam War movement was something which as a youngster I related to, views confirmed when in  i was fortunate enough to visit the lovely country of Vietnam
    I find the music of that period still inspires me as it did as a teenager and as a student
 Interesting to note that along with Les Mis' from  I have the music of Dylan, Tom Paxton and Pete Seeger from the  on my iPod
 Time to reflect further
 Was the experience and memory Ive described a positive one? i think so
 There are many parallels with this episode in my life and what i am attempting to achieve today with my voluntary role as Kent's Dementia Envoy
 Since those student days i have always done my best to help to make a difference, firstly as a relatively moderate, idealistic student, then as a primary school teacher who was committed to ensuring that the children in my care were well looked after and taught, then to a head teacher who strove to achieve a school learning experience in which all involved could be proud
 Using this memory walk experience Im convinced that there is a connection between each of these
   This piece began very differently as an original idea written over a year ago
 Since then, We enjoyed reading 'Dear Fatty, ' by Dawn French, and this is my attempt to follow that thread
  Dear former pupil, As i sit at my desk pondering this letter to you, autumn is swiftly approaching, and is often regarded as a time for reflection as the vivid red, gold and orange foliage transforms the greens of summer to a hot flush before the winter chills set in
 Whilst i do enjoy what this season provides, it is tinged with a little sadness as the realisation sinks in that summer has slipped away like the setting sun, and that one feels about to be gripped with a melancholic iron glove
 As a teacher and a head for over thirty years, early September also saw the end of the long summer break, and a return to life at school
 Whilst i loved my time working with young people like you, i was always unsettled and anxious around the last days of the holiday, and remained so until the first days register was marked, or the opening assembly of the year was completed
 Then, with your smiling faces in front of me, I was comfortable casting off the mooring from the holiday and floating into the new term focusing on you  the most important people in my care
 Rewards from my career far outweigh what i contributed, and I don't mean financially
 Although my salary latterly was far more    than i could have imagined as a teenager leaving my Nottingham council estate, and lm sure there were higher paid jobs out there than teaching, i always saw teaching as a vocation, and i never wavered from that throughout my career
 indeed you helped keep this as my focus
 i am reminded of the wise words of Abraham Lincoln when writing to his child's teacher  years ago
 These were shared with me by the parent of a pupil some years ago, whose view of the teacher he wanted for his child matched my attempts
 i do wish that the OFSTED Gestapo would read and digest these   great words of wisdom  i did and tried to follow them  i hope that this came over to you when i was with you, if not then please accept my sincere apologies: i did try
 As a teacher and head one can make a real difference to the lives of young people, and i derive a great sense of pride and satisfaction every time the paths of a former pupil and myself cross
 For you may be surprised, but in my mind you remain as a child, you have never aged or grown up in my memory
 Childhood is a real treasure and these memories sit well alongside this
 There are so many of you i could write about, and thinking back to that first class, who i remember so vividly, despite the fact that it is now thirtysix years ago and many of you are parents yourself (some of you might even be grandparents!) Soon after being diagnosed, my wife and i attended two meetings of people with a similar diagnosis
 The meeting was designed to bring together those below the age of sixtyfive who had recently been through the local Memory Clinic
 The doctor setting up had an opening slide entitled, Living with dementia, by Dr Richard Brown
 i said to Rosemary as quietly as i could, I taught a Richard Brown about twentyfive years ago in Canterbury
 The last time i saw him he was eleven and moving on to Grammar School, i reckon he must be early to midthirties, about the age of this guy
' The presenter overheard, and to my delight he announced,  'Yes, Mr Oliver, you did teach me for two years and i remember with great fondness being in your class, including your great impression of Gollum when reading The Hobbit to us!   Well, i was amazed
 We chatted at length during the interval and i mentioned to Richard that i still had a project he had written about Australia back in 
 it was excellent, and I had 'borrowed' it to help inspire other subsequent children with writing their projects
 At the next session I was able to ceremoniously return the project to rapturous applause from the group
 Now the roles are reversed: i cared for Richard as his teacher, now as my consultant he cares for me
 Thank you, Richard
 Soon after this, through a mutual friend in Australia, i made contact with Amanda who i had taught in Adelaide back in 
 Amanda was by now a mum and a teacher herself, and indeed had taught in the UK and had tried, unsuccessfully at the time, to contact me
 In October , I had a meeting in London to train as a member of the Alzheimer's Society Research Network
 Rosemary was going to attend this training with me and coincidentally Amanda, her husband and two young children were going to be in London that day
 We had a lovely time together strolling along the South Bank near the London Eye before heading into a restaurant where the food was good and the conversation was great as we shared memories of the year we spent at Norwood Primary School in Adelaide
 i am delighted that so many of you have returned into my life recently, often in the most surprising of circumstances
 in 'An Amazing Day, ' i have written about Amy who contacted BBC radio during the broadcast of my interview with the Prime Minister
 Subsequently i am delighted that we have become friends, and as  i write this we are planning to meet for the first time in over twenty years oh, how time moves so quickly! An even longer gap was the case with Angela, who Rosemary and i recently met by chance at a party of a mutual friend
 i hadn't seen Angela for over thirty years, and whilst we were enjoying the party we were getting ready to leave when Angela came up to introduce herself
 Over an hour later we finally said our goodbyes! Often former pupils will just stop and say hello in the street, and sometimes this leads to me asking,  'What are you doing with yourself these days?' One day in Canterbury, a young woman who was entertaining a growing crowd busking with her musical pals saw me, stopped her performance and came and took me to meet her friends, introducing me as her head teacher and saying lovely things about her time at Blean
 if you read this Milly, you made that day for me and, as i told you at the time, your music was brilliant
 Each September i am asked to deliver a talk to Occupational Therapy students at Canterbury Christ Church University, and at one of these talks a student came toward and introduced himself as Ben who i had taught almost twenty years previously
 it was great to catch up and share what had led him to being on this course, and the work which he hoped to do once he had graduated
 Another opening line I hear from some of you is, 'Are you Mr Oliver? You used to teach me!' As i previously mentioned, although my looks have changed since the time in question, the    adult in front of me has changed much more
 Sometimes this opening question will come from someone coming to do some work at my house, such as Wayne who works for British Gas and now services our boiler, or Thomas who was a lively nipper when I think of him as a ten yeardid in my football team at Barton School, and who has grown into a burly six footer working with an electrical company
 Oneoff contacts are nice, but I really love the feeling I get when someone like you transforms in my mind from the primary school child to the adult who i am proud to say i taught and helped grow into the person who Im delighted to reconnect with, and to not only talk about you, the child, but as the adult you have become
 Once a teacher, always a teacher
 i guess that label fits me to a tee
 Since retiring i do miss the children from school, and to address this for the past three years i have been made extremely welcome at Wincheap Primary School, near to where I live in Canterbury
 i have loved hearing the children read, and have been boosted by the knowledge that i can still engage with young people and support both their learning and their developing confidence
 i am a bit like a grandparent i see them relatively briefly, make a fuss of them, enjoy their company and chats and then disappear until next time, usually the following week
 I am told by the school, and my experience suggests, that i bring much to our time together, but rest assured I take far more away with me when i walk out of the school each time
  Once a teacher, always a teacher
 So far this letter has been reflective and has looked back over the past to close I would like to look to the present and the future
 Maybe there is a link here to my efforts in the Dementia Envoy role
 The work i did with you as your teacher was so important, and my current role is now important in a different, but parallel, way
 i am committed to continuing to utilise any teaching skills i retain to raise awareness around living well with dementia and to challenge stereotypes and stigma
 There are still talks to plan, audiences to speak to, and messages to convey, and as long as i am well enough and have the support We been blessed with to date, i will continue to try to teach
 Thank you and bless you, Your teacher and friend, Keith Oliver    I was very keen to lead a final assembly with the whole school at Blean School to say goodbye at the time of my retirement
 i wrote this for the assembly, and read it alongside an interview written by Year  children
    Thursday th June  was truly an amazing day
 The day began in bright sunshine with a freshly made juice and an inspired meeting with three wonderful, special young people who have become close friends over the past nine months
 These are psychology students from Kent University on placement with Kent  Medway Partnership Trust, and we have supported each other, and been inspired by each other on a number of projects
 l'm absolutely delighted that we still have plans for future projects, amongst which are joint presentations this autumn at an international conference in Glasgow and the UK Dementia Congress in Brighton
 We also talk about lots of nondementia subjects, and that forms a substantial part of our time together and is the best help and support i could wish for
 Rosemary joined us just before noon, and the five of us together shared the experience of listening to the BBC Radio  programme 'You and Yours' which featured a piece with me recorded the previous day and a link to David Cameron, the Prime Minister, to whom i posed a question about dementia research
 I felt tense, waiting for the programme to start
 My piece had been recorded the day before and i was very nervous (unusual for me  the hardest task usually at events these days is deciding which shirt to wear not the increasingly large audiences i seem to be speaking to!) i hadn't heard back my answers to the questions asked of me, and i had no idea what the PM would be asked or    would say
 i thought David Cameron came across very well sincere in his mission to make life better for those with dementia NOW and to put more money into this, and dedicated to finding a cure or other treatmentsmedication to arrest its progress
 He made kind, specific reference to my answers and my approach to living as positively as possible with dementia
 i was most moved by a former pupil, who must now be in her early s, emailingphoning the show live to express wonderful sentiments about her time in my class back in the s
 How i would love to thank Amy personally for this
 Subsequently we are in email contact and will hopefully have met again by the time you are reading this piece
 Then the three students and I went into Canterbury for our sixth and final life writing class with eight people with dementia, our talented tutor, Liz, and our five patient and skilled student supporters
 This was a marvellous project funded partly by DEEP and partly by the Alzheimer's Society and we were very excited that it culminated in the publication of this book of our collected writings about our lives  something we are reliably informed has never been done by a group of people with dementia anywhere! Individuals have written their stories and groups have written for their own eyes but never in this way
 We all hope that you are enjoying our efforts: exciting! When i got home and turned the computer on comments were starting to arrive from personal and professional friends  about the programme
 Whilst these comments mean so much to me personally, they really belong to so many other people who fight alongside me, those i know and those i have still to meet, all of whom are choosing to step through the door
 I hope that by buying and reading this book, you can come through the door with us
 Ive included some of the comments here, to share:  Whilst these comments are wonderful to receive, the one received    by text from my daughter was a marvellous conclusion that even England's defeat by Uruguay (in the World Cup) on the same day couldnt tarnish
 Karon, my daughter told me that she and my grandson had heard the Radio  programme and that I was 'the best granddad in the world
 i ask for no more  and don't deserve that accolade  but l'll gratefully take it
 It did make me cry like i hadn't for some time  tears of pride and joy
 As the day drew to a close, the sun was still shining and Rosemary and i sat in a reflective, relaxed mood, in our favourite spot on our patio with a cuppa and a biscuit looking out over the farmland, the meandering river and wild marshland which we are blessed to have next to our house
 i said on the programme, and on the day i was first tentatively diagnosed, one door closes and one door opens: there are many more doors for me to open in the future!  I wrote this on the second session of our Life Writing course
 A Kenning is a poem of no more than eight lines, two words per line and each line ends in er'
    Every four years the nation seems to unite in hoping that our footballers will do themselves justice at the world cup, and this year is no exception
 Writing this soon after England's narrow defeat against Italy, the pressure on the players seems to be mounting
 i suspect some of the reasons for this date back nearly fifty years to th July , when Bobby Moore, as captain, held aloft the world cup trophy for the Wembley crowd to admire
 Little would we imagine that all these years later no Englishman has yet repeated this act
 I was ten years old at the time and remember that warm, sunny day well
 The nation had been gripped by football fever for three weeks with many matches broadcast in grainy black and white, not from the other side of the world but from places such as Liverpool and Sheffield
 The world cup song and mascot was World Cup Willie,' a lion dressed in the union jack with a jingoistic pop song to accompany his proud strutting around the TV adverts
 As always for me the day began with a bowl of cornflakes I usually had them unless a different cereal had a more tempting free gift lurking in the packet
 The advantage of cornflakes was that their gift was often a figure to cut out from the outside of the packet so you could more easily collect the set
 in  it was famous people and the one i had to cut out and assemble that day was William Shakespeare
 After breakfast my mother could never keep me in the house
  I wanted to see my mates before the build up for the match
 We usually headed for the wasteland near the local library where my mates and I had a den
 We usually played war  TV and cinema films at that time were nearly all of the how we won the war genre
 i can see us in my mind now, four or five ten yearold lads walking along carrying impressively real toy guns and rifles  mine was a Cowboy Winchester
 Probably much imaginary blood was spilled and lives lost in the cause of our fun
 I remember a lad coming along named Clive who introduced himself as Clive, like Clive of India'
 He was about our age, and I wonder how many ten yearolds on a council estate would introduce themselves as having the same name as an th century soldier today
 What we also did with Clive was swap Brooke Bond tea cards  Trees in Britain was the set at that time
 i never saw Clive again but that has stuck in my memory
 I nearly always lost track of time when out with my mates but not this day
 i was back home in good time to catch the pre match community singing of songs such as  Abide with Me,' and the marching band of one of the guards regiments before the two captains proudly led their teams out of the Wembley tunnel to be greeted by a wave of noise never before seen or heard in a football stadium in this country
 The match: well, it ebbed and flowed
 Geoff Hurst scored first for England, blondhaired Haller equalised before Martin Peters leapt to head England back into the lead, and that is how it stayed    During the final Life Writing session Liz, our tutor set us the task in just a few minutes to create a list poem' by describing things which we had with us on that day, either in a handbag, a pocket or a carrier bag
 We were directed to list out seven items and conclude the piece with the final two lines which Liz supplied, and we personalised by inserting our own name
   in one life writing session, we viewed newsreel pieces from the late s and early 's which prompted this piece
 it was written as a collaboration between myself and psychology student, Sophie Razzel
     The inspiration for this piece is multifaceted
 Firstly the notes were scribbled on a notepad zooming through the French countryside en route in the Eurostar from Ashford to Avignon
 I find the northern French countryside less attractive than that below Lyon, consequently my mind wandering was more fruitful at this time
 Allied to this i was reading David Sedaris and Jennifer Saunders
 To Sedaris, i attribute the desire to embarrass my family, and to Jennifer my thanks for inspiring any humour you may detect in the words that follow
 My first trip across the channel was with two other mates, soon after graduating from University, and we blew the proceeds of a holiday job in buying two tents and a Eurorailcard to explore La Belle France
 We decided to pass through Paris and make for Biarritz as we had heard there was great surf there, good campsites and warm weather, and then to follow this by moving across to the Med and staying just outside Paris on the way back
 Loaded with tents and large rucksacks we pulled into Gare du Nord, and to save a few francs decided to walk across the city to Gare d'Austerlitz
 Little did we know the route would take us through La Pigalle which in those days made Soho look like a church picnic
 Despite living close to the red light area of Sheffield as a   student, I saw sights that night that appear in no tourist guide, and I hadn't seen before or since
 I am pretty sure that the ladies of the night realised we werent interested
 The only new experience i was tempted by that evening was a donor kebab, which i did indulge in for the first and only time in my life
 Once we arrived in sunny and breezy Biarritz and had pitched our tents, like all good Englishmen we needed to put the kettle on the primus
 Directly opposite us were three French girls who were about our age, and were clearly using us as their source of entertainment
 No, not that! Not at La Pigalle and not here! They were obviously chatting about us and didn't realise that Dave was a fluent French speaker and qualified to teach French, and unbeknown to them he understood every word
 He let them go on for ages and discretely relayed to us that they were saying The English are having their teal' before breaking the ice and revealing his linguistic talent
 Well, as you can imagine their red suntanned faces went several shades brighter after this revelation! Staying with a continental theme, my father hated foreign food
 In fact, he wouldn't even refer to it as food, calling it 'foreign muck, although a favourite flan was in his words 'Quick Lorraine
' i never did discover who she was! My favourite shops are book shops
 I just love browsing in them,   buying books for myself and for others
 Rosemary went through a phase of enjoying books set in the wildlife parks of southern Africa and, after reading a review, asked me if i could buy Last of the Free by Gareth Patterson for her birthday
 i was happy to have a suggestion to assist with present buying, so went into my local bookshop a few days later
 it wasn't on the shelves so i went to the counter and told the young assistant the title of the volume I was after
 After some typing into the computer, his expression became at first puzzled and then a bit alarmed
 A queue was beginning to form behind me when he said, Im sorry sir this book doesn't appear to exist on our system
' Im sure it does,' I replied, 'we read a really positive review in Saturday's Daily Mail
' To which he turned his computer screen in my direction and said, 'There is no book, sir, called Lust for Free
 He showed me the books he had been searching amongst, and i was shocked by the range of adult titles there in front of me
 No wonder he was alarmed
 i was as well  and embarrassed
 I glanced nervously over my shoulder at the growing queue hoping that no one else could see the screen
 After a quick excuse (based upon my northern accent) the correct title was bought, ordered, purchased and read! Rosemary is a very good artist, indeed I would describe her as talented and, although extremely modest about her abilities, some   of her favourite pieces enhance our walls at home
   In order for them to be hung we have a picture framer who we know well and trust
   Fortunately he knows us well and knows that we are inclined  towards 'senior moments on occasions
  One such occasion involved a phone call Rosemary made to  him about wanting to frame her latest piece
 Ian needing to know  the orientation of the piece asked her if it was 'landscape or  portrait' to which Rosemary her naivety replied, No its a dog
 Im pretty sure that wasnt the response he expected, and much laughter ensued
   Our grandson, William, is our youngest family member
 He's six at the time of writing, and attends the same first school where his mum Karon is deputy head
 William is a very bright boy with a very sharp sense of humour, but on this occasion I'm not sure that this prompted this story
  Karon asked him one day when he had not long started school, how the day had gone
 Like most children he wasn't terribly forthcoming, but did say he enjoyed going into the cold drinks room
  This puzzled Karon who said, 'We don't have a cold drinks room William,' to  which he replied, 'Yes we do, its the ICT room  read it aloud and youll see the the humour!   Gareth, our eldest son, has worked in insurance since leaving university, and had done so with the same company for a number of years without seeking any substantial promotion
 He is a shy, reserved chap who appears quite laid back
 A few years ago his company was putting together a special team to develop a project and internally advertised for members including someone with a creative background
 This appealed greatly to Gareth who had an art degree and was, I guess, a bit frustrated that his considerable artistic skills hadn't been utilised during his work, so he applied and was interviewed
 At the interview he was very nervous, and to lessen his nerves he prepared answers in his mind beforehand
 Anticipating the question why hadn't he pushed himself forward previously either in the company or through a move elsewhere, he came' up with what he thought would be the perfect answer: the visual image of a beautiful butterfly emerging from a Chrysalis
 Unfortunately, his nerves sabotaged this answer
 Gareth managed to express the first part as intended, before his nerves kicked in and he concluded the answer with feeling that this was 'An opportunity to emerge like a butterfly from a clitoris
 Memorable Im sure for the interview panel, and  yes  he not only got the job, but he simultaneously gave us one of our best ever family stories!  Teaching was a wonderful career to have and has left me with some fabulous memories: some serious, some sad, and some very funny
 One i retold at an Alzheimer's Society Christmas Carol Service in London, when retelling a story from a Christmas card from a lovely Year  child named Kirsty, which read, 'To Mr Oliver, the best teacher in the world'  she should have stopped there but she went on to write, 'You teached me good
' i considered attaching that to my next job application, but thought better of it! Early in my career I taught in Crewe for a short time and had a very difficult class with equally difficult parents, one of whom came to see me at Parent's Evening  this in itself was cause for celebration  but this mother came with the biggest badge I can remember proudly advertising 'l love sex and darts' (Im not sure in which order!) A week or two later she also wrote to me about Christopher, her son, who had been absent for a day with according to her scribbled letter diarhere, direr, and, finally, the shits, plainly written
  Also around that time I was new to the school and getting to know the children and the parents
 I was meeting the parents of a Year  boy to discuss their choices for potential secondary schools
 One popular choice in Canterbury is the Archbishops Church of England School, which is always quite difficult to get into, and clearly was their first choice
 i went into detail at some length about the difficulty of getting    a place, to which they gradually got more and more jovial and animated which rather surprised me and caused me to say please let me in on the joke which was clearly developing at my expense
 i genuinely didnt know what the source of their merriment was
 To put me in the picture the mother said I don't think that will be a problem as the Archbishop is his grandfather and my dad!' Needless to say that is where Archbishop Careys grandson went
 Humour builds resilience, positivity and, consequently, better health
 People who retain a sense of humour are better able to deal with adversity and problems
 I think it's crucial to understand that, whilst humour cannot provide a cure, or the answers to our desire to keep dementia at bay, it certainly helps deal with the challenges that it presents
  Travel so enriches one's life
 Along with Australia, in the last couple of years we have travelled on the Eurostar to Avignon, taken an autumn break on the alluring Amalfi coast and spent a sunny week in June in Menton in southern France, alongside a first visit to Scotland at the age of fiftyfive
 All of these have added to my rich reservoir of holiday experiences
 Whilst the memory of what i did, said and thought is perhaps not as clear in my mind as I would wish, the overall feeling of positivity and wellbeing accrued from these trips lasts long after the cases are unpacked and consigned to the loft, until the next one
 Other memorable holidays Rosemary and i have enjoyed include twice going to Paphos in Cyprus which we did really like, and during one of these holidays we took a day trip to Cairo, yes Cairo! Bonkers, i know, but a great experience! We flew from Paphos early in the morning and arrived in Cairo to be greeted by a coach with its own armed guard, as at that time there had been some disturbances where tourists had been targeted
 After a first stop at a rather formidably beautiful mosque, we headed for the pyramids
 I remember looking in one direction and all you could see beyond the three pyramids (one of which was that of Cheops who I remembered learning about when i was about twelve) was a vast expanse of the Sahara desert, and then, turning around, one saw dilapidated, unfinished high rise flats marking the outer suburbs of    Cairo
 I managed to crawl through various tunnels in the heat of the day to reach the centre of the one open pyramid, only to be disappointed by merely an empty chamber  i guess i expected more from watching the Indiana Jones movies
 The treasures of the pyramids had been removed to the main museum in the city and that was our next stop (after a lovely lunch in a hotel nearby) where we had a couple of hours enthralled and entranced by the rich treasures on display, the highlights of which for us were those associated with Tutankhamun
 Never have we seen anything so impressively crafted, with such rich materials and gold in abundance
 From the past to the present our next stop on the whistle stop tour was to be jostled and squashed in a very busy bazaar area where everyone seemed out to convince us that what they Were selling was special and worth buying
 We werent tempted other than a couple of papyrus bookmarks which i still have somewhere, tucked away in a drawer
 After this a sitdown was needed, and we made for a boat trip on the Nile, where a show was put on for everyone's entertainment the highlight of which was a rather glamorous belly dancer  who performed whilst we were eating (maybe to encourage us not to eat too much in order not to expand our waistlines!) After this we were whisked back to the airport for a late night flight back to Paphos, tired but buoyed by the memories of a wonderfully inspiring day
    No one could have escaped the images back in the s of the Vietnam War, it seemed to be on the news every evening more shooting, more napalm, more tears, more protests
 To my generation, Vietnam was associated with all of this and consequently fascinated me as i sensed the country had much more to offer
 Then, in  a parent at my school put me in touch with the Christina Nobel Foundation and we sponsored a child named Liem
 At the time, Liem was aged ten and lived a very basic existence in a small village just outside Ho Chi Minh City with his blind mother
 We would receive a report from the Foundation every so often and i was keen to go and visit Vietnam and to see Liem and take gifts from our school community
 A year later, in April , Rosemary and i made the trip and, with the assistance of Thai Airlines, took boxes of gifts such as pencils, crayons, toothpaste and some new clothes  Tshirts mainly  from the school and Marks  Spencers who supported us
  From the outside, the charities administration building where we met Liem with his mother and staff from the charity was quite rundown,like so much of that area of the city away from the tourist trails
 Clearly he was nervous, as indeed were we, but with the patient reassurance from the Foundation staff, who acted as interpreters, we had a lovely hour or so together
 The teacher translated and gifts were exchanged  he crafted us a lovely table and set of chairs from beer cans  i guess this skill was learnt in   order to sell the items
 This was very touching, and had clearly taken him a lot of time to make
 For many years afterwards his gift was proudly displayed in a special glass cabinet outside of my school office for the children and visitors to admire
 Liem also shyly sang for us, an old Vietnamese folk song, which I was able to video to show the children back in England
 Mariene (my deputy from school) had bought him a watch which he was so proud to wear, and he constantly kept looking at it almost in total disbelief
 One other lasting impression I had was that despite being so very poor, (Liem and his mother lived in a small hut made of mud and wood, with a coconut tree outside which they proudly told us provided them with food (the flesh), drink (the milk) and fuel (the shells)), they were both very clean, and Liem would not have looked out of place in his MS 'Beckham' Tshirt back at Blean school in Kent
 We continued to sponsor Liem right through his education into secondary school, including sending the money for the purchase of a bike to enable him to travel from his tiny hamlet to his school several miles away
 Contact did diminish as he moved into his teens: a bit inevitable I guess
 The children at Blean saw him as one of our school and i do often wonder how he got on and what he is doing now
   This piece was written after the writing course with the support of psychology student, Sophie Razzel, and my wife Rosemary
 it was inspired by a desire to share some experiences of past travels, and to maybe inspire future ones by myself and others
  A desire to travel and a love of visiting new places so enriches one's experience of life
 i have always enjoyed visiting new places and revisiting some old favourites
 i suspect my love for this was nurtured as a child in the s, when my parents chose to spend what little money we had on annual holidays
 We alternated between an English south coast and joining the exodus of sun worshippers heading south to the Spanish costas, Jersey and the Austrian Tyrol, where we searched the hills which were promised to be alive with the sound of music
 This is one reason why i was so upset when advised to cancel our annual trip to Australia (see piece entitled Ill never forget the time i went) by the neurologist, on the day it was suggested that i had dementia
 Whilst dementia does present certain challenges to overcome, it is still possible to safely and comfortably travel
 The way we recall and engage with our memories of past holidays is rather like the way we do with favourite pieces of music: both have the power to transport us to a past time and place, and enrich the present moment by exercising our memory
 One should never underestimate the benefits one can gain from    a good holiday and the excitement, feelgood factor and interest which it often brings to the traveler
 Since our year in Australia in , when i did a teacher exchange and lived in Adelaide, we have revisited many times, and have been fortunate enough to have some wonderful memories with our Aussie mates and to have travelled extensively in this vast country
 You can never see all of a country this size
 Adelaide is like a second home to us, and is a wonderfully laid back, beautiful city with a vibrant cultural scene, great beaches and wonderful hills overlooking the modern city which, until the late s, was bushland, swamp and scrub
 Beyond Adelaide there are the wine regions of the Barossa and McLaren Vale where the sunkissed grapes make great red and white wine, needless to say we have many favourites  for medicinal purposes, of course! Hahndorf, a small piece of Germany transported across the world to South Australia, is a favourite destination of ours about forty minutes' drive out of Adelaide, where we can browse shops, cafes and restaurants, and even call into a German pub for a stain of ice cold beer
 Moving east from Adelaide, although not so keen on Melbourne, (it reminded me of Manchester with sunshine), rural Victoria has some spectacular coastal scenery along the Great Ocean Road and some classic Aussie rural scenery with sheep farms, sheep farms and more sheep farms: i love the sunburned country
 Sydney became one of our favourite Australian places we've visited, where we enjoyed the beauty of the harbour and the iconic   opera house and 'coat hanger' bridge and tuned into the pace and buzz of a wonderfully vibrant, beautiful place to visit
 North to Queensland which, in the dry season, is a world away from one's experience in Europe  the Barrier Reef for all its problems is still as the name suggests: Great
 Whilst on the reef Rosemary hired an underwater camera and took some great photos whilst snorkeling and James and i went sshing, returning our catch to the turquoise waters
  Although the towns of Cairns and Townsville are worth seeing, the highlight for us was a week spent on Magnetic island a thirtyminute ferry trip from Townsville
 The island is a tropical paradise, named by Captain Cook due to the disturbance cause to his ship's compass
  Staying tropical, but moving into the Northern Territory
 Darwin is a great location to do the 'Crocodile Dundee experience and we did, spending five days out in the bush with the crocodiles learning to identify the difference between the 'salties which would eat you and the 'freshies' which wouldn't  I think i learnt this! Rosemary also had the bravery to ride on the back of Charlie the water buffalo, made famous for being hypnotised by Crocodile Dundee in that hilarious first film
  Next stop, Perth
 The capital of Western Australia reminds me of Adelaide: modern, well planned with beautiful beaches and the added benefit of the Swan River and the manicured Kings Park looming majestically over the city
 Perth is, though, more isolated from the rest of Australia and is closer geographically (and some would say economically and culturally) to Singapore than it is to    Sydney
 So far, like most Australians, we've stuck to the coastal fringe: it's now time to move inland to explore what's commonly known as The Outback
 Alice Springs, known as the capital of The Outback, has grown in size and stature between our first visit in  and our return in  without losing the feel of a town on the edge of the desert
 in  we were viewing the town as part of a large group of teachers and families spending two weeks in the outback visiting incredible places such as Coober Pedy,  kilometers north of Adelaide
 Coober Pedy means White Man's Hole' in aboriginal, and is there because of the opal mines which dominate the area
 This was our first night and was spent in a motel underground
 Most of the accommodation in the town is underground, as indeed are the two town churches
 One building above ground was the supermarket and I remember seeing for sale in there dynamite along with the cereals and washing up liquid
 Very useful
 At that time, a popular film was 'A Cry in the Dark', starring Meryl Streep as Lindy Chamberlain
 This was the story of her losing her baby to a dingo while camping near Uluru
 We visited Uluru, to photograph it at sunset, to walk around it during the day and to climb it
 The ascent is steep and arduous and was too much for six yearold James who, unsurprisingly, found the hike up too challenging
 Fortunately a stranger who was descending as we were ascending, offered to take him and look after him while  we continued the climb, an offer we gratefully accepted
 An hour and a half later, the family was reunited and all was well
 Not a dingo in sight
 Moving forwards to , and our next visit to The Outback was for a three day stop in Alice Springs, whilst taking the Ghan train from Darwin right across Australia, north to south, to Adelaide
 The Ghan is one of the world's iconic railway journeys, travelling  km and taking nearly three days to complete if you are inclined to do it in one stint
 Far better to do as we did, and break the journey in the middle in Alice Springs
 Building the railway from Adelaide to Alice Springs was a long and painful process taking from    and named after the Afghans who helped, with their camels who carried the heavy equipment used to build it
 (Subsequently the camels were released and formed a population larger than that in Saudi Arabia!) The portion from Alice to Darwin wasn't completed until   this after a three year building programme
 There are four standards of travel, red (you get a seat), silver gives you a bed and shared facilities, gold (which is how we travelled) gives you your own compartment with bunk beds and its own smallbutcosy toilet and shower and some great meals, and then there is platinum, which gives even more salubrious four star hotel style sleeping accommodation on the train
 The journey was fascinating, and to travel day and night on a train was a new experience to us
 Each meal time you would sit with a different couple of people and engage  as is usually the    case where Aussies are concerned  with some great conversation
 Although not spectacular the scenery is fascinating and illustrated again the vast emptiness and rugged beauty of the outback
 Again this experience would have been missed had I taken the professional medical advice
 Since being diagnosed, we haven't ventured outside of South Australia (SA) feeling that it was much easier  and just as fulfilling to spend time in a place we know quite well, often, with friends whose company we love
 This is not a negative at all, as SA has so much to offer for a four week stay, and swapping the Pommie winter for an SA summer is a pretty good deal
 Had I taken the advice of the neurologist back in , I would have missed out on so much
 That said, we have made adaptations to allow us to enjoy future trips and I would like to share these suggestions in the hope that this advice encourages other people with a similar diagnosis to consider ways of facilitating enjoyable and safe travel
 Key principle: allow ample time  travel can be very tiring but VERY enjoyable!  Travel with another person  insurancecompanionshipshared experience at the time and afterwards laying down memories
 Travel Insurance be honest with companies, most will cover single trips for those with dementia
 When making the booking discuss this with a doctor sharing your care
 A letter from your GP regarding the medication you're carrying is advisable
 in some cases a supporting letter  from a consultant might be helpful
 Think carefully about the place you intend to visit  is it busyquiet? Crowds can be difficult: do you know the area? i like to go to a mix of the new and the familiar
 The itinerary  best not to plan too much and consider rest days as well as active ones
 Check that you have sufficient medication for the whole visit, plus a few days' extra in case of delayed flightstravel
 i would strongly advise that your medication goes in your hand luggage rather than in the hold  you have it with you, and it will not get lost
  Help from tour operator with online seat allocation both in the UK and when confirming for return this is usually  hours prior to departure s Making checkin staff aware at the airport  enlisting their help through customs and security by: Requesting early boarding of aircraft which usually means sitting in a specific area at the departure gate
 Ensuring they make cabin crew aware  ideally this can be done via the tour operator when booking the flightholiday
 They will remind you of medication if required
 Use of MAAS badge (Meet and Assist Service) to help with luggage retrieval and customs if required upon return to UK
 All of the above can easily be discretely and sensitively achieved with no fuss or embarrassment to ensure that travel is as stress free and enjoyable as possible despite the difficulties which conditions such as dementia can present
    l would strongly recommend that you consult the following very helpful Alzheimer's Society factsheet number  entitled 'Travelling and going on holiday', available from:     On days when my dementia is stronger and i can't get the most basic words, i get very anxious and all i want is to get back to the time when, as a child, i believed that dogs barked, cats meowed and human beings spoke my mother language
 How it all was so simple then! My father had explained to me that in other countries people spoke other languages, but only when i was eleven and at school starting to learn French was i confronted with the evidence that in France they spoke French, and, two years later, that in England they spoke English
 For a further four years my school friends and i were drilled in both grammars, and then if we had shown any promise we would have another two years to learn how to translate into those languages
 But i have always thought that speaking a foreign language is a very difficult process
 i used to think of it as working on a trapeze without a safety net
 You have to leave the emotional comfort zone of your mothertongue to this other world of strange sounds
 Your ears and your vocal cords are not used to these new sounds
 Your brain has to cope with a new syntax and a different way to see and describe yourself and the world around you
 I was very lucky to have been taught by excellent teachers who were able to make me relax and not feel like a fool
 Miss Mary Leigh was the one for my last two years, and she was formidablem
She was imposing to look at because of her height and her hair colour: she was very tall with wide shoulders and big bones
 Her hair, which she wore long and loose, was thick and red
She dressed very well, i thought
 Her clothes were plain, functional, and of very good material and cut
 Tweed trousers and skirts with sweaters in winter and simple cotton dresses and skirts
in summer: not mannish
 She was a very liberated woman who lived alone in a foreign country and did what she liked
The only things out of character were the chiffon scarves and a Victorian ring she wore on her left hand
 it had an amethyst surrounded by seed pearls
 it looked incongruous too dainty on her large hands
 She used to fiddle with it all the time
 i remember
that because i would lose concentration watching her turn it
around and around with her right thumb and forefinger
 On her first class she told us that English was a common
sense language with plain, serviceable words
 No Latin frippery,' she would say
 Spare me from too many
adjectives and adverbs
 Never say you are absolutely terrified, if you are bloody terrified you don't need an absolutely'
'
So, what was bloody? We all wondered, but couldn't ask because we were all terrified
 However, from then on, bloody' became my favourite adjective in the English language
Never use Sunday words, pedantic words: i hear them everyday,' she loved to say
 Just stick to plain language, come to the point, it will serve you well
Not one of us dared point out to her that a week without a Sunday was a very sad thing
 She would have said, For goodness sake, don't be boring!' The last time i saw her, she had summoned me for dinner at
her favourite restaurant
 We were both much older
 She was over eighty, a bit shorter
in height, her hair no longer on fire but more like pale straw and she used two walking sticks
i told her how i used to think that learning a foreign language was like working on a trapeze without a safety net, but that she had been always there for me
 i thanked her for it
Well, you weren't that bad, you know,' she said, while asking the waiter for another bottle of her favourite Douro wine
Now, on foggy brain days, i wish i could tell her that i want to go back to when i only knew one language, not four
i can hear her saying, Don't be silly! Keep on' Yes, Miss Mary Leigh Ill try for you
Your father and i went to the beach yesterday
 it was a very hot day and we sat by some rocks under an umbrella
 The smelt of the sea, made stronger by the proximity of the rocks, reminded me of our days at the beach when you were two, and i was thirty
We used to arrive at ten, when the sun hadn't made the sand too hot to walk on bare feet
 We would drop the straw bag with the towels, buckets, spades and sun lotion onto the sand
You were always so eager to get the buckets and spades out of the bag
 Your bucket was bright red with blue boats and white sails
 it matched your red hat perfectly
 Next i would cover you in suntan lotion
 You were then ready for a day of serious work
Castle building with sand requires concentration
 You can't use sand either too dry or too wet
 it has to have just the right wetness
 if too dry it runs through your fingers, and if too wet it becomes a gritty liquid that doesn't hold its shape
 we would look for the strip of beach that the tide could barely reach, and that the sun was starting to warm up
 There the best sand could be found
 You would fill your bucket, then we would press the sand down to get rid of the excess water
 i would help you to turn the bucket upside down and the material for starting the walls of our castle was ready
 Your little hands would press it into shapes that sand castle architects recommend as sturdy and firm for castle walls
We would get very hot as the building progressed, so when we would hear the swish of the tide coming close we would wait for the cool water with our building
 to freshen our hands When the last wall so that we could keep up was finished we would smooth the whole castle gently so that it wouldn't fall down Because we didn't want it to dry out, we would cover it with the sea shells we had collected
 There it stood all white and sandcolour against the green sea
 You would clap your hands and call Claudia to see your splendid castle
 She would call back from the water, where she was splashing about with her friends, saying how great your castle was
 We would then stand back on the dry sand under the canvas shade, because by then the sun would be high and the sand too hot under our feet
 Sitting down blue, the sea so later green, on the soft towels, looking at the sky so both contrasting with the white sand, our castle made of sand and sea with your shrieks of delight
 looked part of it all
 And so did you , With a big hug from, Your Mother
My daughter Claudia, was sixteen and we were coming to Europe from New Zealand
 Claudia asked the very nice Singapore Airhostess, 'Could we have some champagne? Today is my mother's fortieth birthday
 i told Claudia they don't give champagne in Economy
But they did! We had a lovely flight
 Paris looked even more beautiful than i remembered  if that were possible  when we arrived
 Eighteen years earlier, my husband and i had spent our honeymoon there
 Another present on my th was going to the louvre and watching Claudia's face when she saw Manet's Olympia
 She had been studying Manet for her Art History exam and there it was: 'Oh my God, it is so much better than in the book,' she said
 Her sixteenyear old eyes couldn't believe what she was seeing, neither could mine looking at hers
 Such a long time ago, but just like yesterday
 Farrusca Farrusca and her sisters and in Auckland, New Zealand
 brothers were born under our house Her mother Eventually, she was feral, and nobody could go near moved them to the storage space garage and my brave husband began a relationship despite all the hissing and spitting
 her kittens
 above our with them, As time passed, they began to feel at Our children loved them all, but we home with us
 couldn't keep kittens
 We distributed them among our friends and felt for a long time
 so many very sad We kept Farrusca, because she was shy and beautiful
 She was a very elegant grey with the most striking greenyellow She was the most gentle cat i have ever known
 eyes
 Her world slept, and spent birds
 was her in the garden where time climbing up trees she enjoyed the sun, and scaring the singing in the evening of the children
 she loved watching television on the lap of one Sometimes, dead mouse, so She was a child or sister
 first thing in that we would cat, after all, the morning, she would bring know how much she loved us
 although we thought of her as us a our 
I'll never forget the th of January, 
 The portrait painter came to deiiver the portrait of Mrs
 Morris
 It was a rainy day, and he wore a grey raincoat over a sage green sweater that his mother had knitted
 He introduced himself
 'i'm David Steel, the portrait painter who has been painting Mrs
 Morris
 She told me about you
' 'Oh' I said, 'i'm Maria Joana Castro is Gama, and I'm the au pair
' God! I thought, He is very good looking! And that was how I met the man who would be my children's father
 I remember afternoons at the house of my greatgrandmother and grandmother, when they chatting and embroidering, would have friends for knitting and crocheting
 coffee white r  I was about sixyearsold then, but my memory of those afternoons has never faded
 I My greatgrandmother taught me to knit with brass needles I and black wool, while my grandmother showed me how to crochet with white cotton and a bone hook
 I can still hear the sound of the brass knitting the black wool
 I can't remember what they said, but I remember the sound of their voices and the smell of black coffee
 They died a long time ago, but what they taught me hasn't gone, and even in days of thick brainfog I can use my hands, make something and feel creative and alive, thanks to those great ladies
 So when I sewed the ribbons onto the hat of my granddaughter Sadie, to protect her from the Sydney sun, I thought: she will pass it on to her sister Frida, and in years to come they will also remember me for that hat
i arrived for the first time in London in the October of 
 My father wouldn't allow me to come to England, so i had to wait until i was twentyone to get a passport
The day when i left my capital city was a bright day, and that beautiful city was truly the City of Light'
When the plane landed at Heathrow, the captain said in our language, Thank you for flying with us
 The temperature in London is nine degrees and there is a light rain
'
Some guitar music followed
 For a few moments i thought i wanted to go back, but i didn't
 in the London of the ', i became an au pair in Belgravia
 At the language school i went to, other girls my age from Germany, Austria, italy, Spain and France became my friends
 Because we didn't have much money, we used to go to a Lyons' Corner coffee place
 We complained about the coffee, but we all in our different accents agreed that we loved London
 Coming from a small town where everybody knew who my father, my uncles and the rest of the family was  for the first time
 i was anonymous
 Just me, i was
 i still love London, which made me free and the owner of myself
On the next th of September you will be threeyearsold
 i remember the time we went to Sydney for your first birthday
Then you were the loveliest and most beautiful baby girl
 What a joy it was to be with you!
Your grandfather and i used to walk to Redfern Park with you in your buggy
 i still can see your little red shoes going up and down with the excitement of soon going on the swings and slides at the approaching park
 You were so happy!
One year later we would do the same walk but by then we would collect twigs from the parks many trees, so that we could make little houses that brought smiles to your beautiful face
But by then you were two years old and could run like a little rabbit, chasing the ibis birds that lived in the Park, and laughing a lot, seeing those two oldies trying to keep up with you
 Wonderful mornings of sun and eucalyptusfresh air!
You would get tired and when we arrived back at home for lunch you would be ready to sit down
 After eating you would love to listen to a story about a family of rabbits with a patient mother
A year is a long time for you
 You have grown a lot and learned so many more words
 A year for us now goes very fast and we forget a lot
 And, do you know darling, your grandparents are a little shorter!
Thank you for being Sadie, our lovely granddaughter
 Happy thi
rd birthday! Two big hugs and kisses
From, your Grandmother
in some ways, I was pleased when my diagnosis of dementia confirmed
 I didn't know, and couldn't understand why I having such problems, and so I was really quite pleased when I was told, 'yes, you do have dementia' (or 'you will have dementia'!)
The children were very good I mean they had to be told
 I did and this difficult, and made sure that my husband was with me when we told them, because I knew we all had to be together to do it
 It was something that had to be done
 I didn't want to pretend nothing had happened
 I can't see the point in that, because eventually I would have had to have not pretended', because I couldn't have physically maintained the pretense anymore!
I have good days and bad days
 I'm still surviving! But I do find sometimes, it's difficult, particularly in the afternoons
 Whether it's just because I'm tired, or something more than this I don't know, but I find the afternoons very difficult
 At the moment it is certainly memory that is most affected by my dementia
 I can still do many everyday tasks, such as cleaning the house, and remembering! For talking to people example today has on the phone been particularly but bad
 it's It's been one of those days where everything begins fine, and then it just hits me
 On the whole however, and considering what my husband and t are going through, I think most of the time, we are coping
quite well
 My husband has been superb, (and he always will be, I know), but there are times when i really don't know what I'm doing: Why am I here, what's happening?' But we've got to keep going
Luckily my daughters are very supportive, and even my grandchildren, (apart from the youngest, who can't take it in quite yet), know what's happening
 in fact, we're seeing more of them than ever now, which is lovely
 They could quite easily have said, Oh well, we'll see you a couple of times a year', but they haven't
i quite often have the grandchildren over, the eldest of whom is now twelve, and who still rings me up and asks, Nanny, when am I coming to see you again?' Obviously, they don't know everything that's happening, but they know Nanny's not well, and it doesn't affect them at all
I have found the ForgetMeNots have been very good
 it is great to see people still doing lots of good things', interesting and worthwhile projects, despite our dementia
 I realize that people are all going to be at different levels, and some days I'm fine and some days I'm not, so I understand this well!
i certainly still enjoy life, and my husband and I still do a lot together
 On the whole (touch wood) we are coping
 I'm still looking after the house I enjoy doing our wonderful garden and our allotment, which takes up a large proportion of our time, but keeps us busy!
i still love reading, which is important to me as i have always done a lot of reading, and if i could no longer read I would be thinking gosh, what do I do next! However, at the moment i am still reading everything i want to together, particularly walks along the beach
 When it comes to dementia, you just have to take it a day at a time
home from work until  o'clock in the evenings, and when home he just needed to have a nice meal with his wife and myself, and then enjoy his free time relaxing
My mum stayed at home as a housewife, which was just the way at the time
 But we had a good life, considering that my parents didn't have a lot of money, i was made to feel that i was special
 I was very lucky, i had lovely parents
As a child, i remember playing with my Grandmother's old button box when I used to visit her
 I used to love going to her house, she had a really old house, and she was lovely
 She had the most beautiful garden
 it was only a very long narrow garden, but it was absolutely fantastic
 It was all her own doing, she loved gardening
She always got loads of food, and fed me up when I went round
 I remember the raspberries
 She used to grow them in the garden, and strawberries as well
 i used to help her pick them and she would make raspberry jam
 She was well known for her raspberry jam! She also made her own bread every day, to eat with the jam: the smell in her kitchen was delicious! Loads and loads of food! it shows how different things are now, fewer people
do this
 She was lovely
 A very kind lady when you look back, she
would always help other people
 People would go to her if they had a problem, a bit of an agony aunt, but she was happy to do it
 Funnily enough, my children then adored that button box
 They were both tinytiny but they loved the button box
 They would play with it for hours and hours and hours
 And now when my granddaughter (who is now eight) comes to stay with me, she plays with the button box! The very same button box as my grandmother used to have that I played with all those years ago
At school, we had quite a nice circle of friends
 Not a lot of friends, but the ones I did have were a good circle, and we got on together well and did lots of things together
 We all had separate desks at school, with all the boys on one side of the classroom, and all the girls on the other
 We could get together, but only out of the classroom! In break times we could socialize with the boys if we wanted to spend our breaks running around with them
 i think on the whole we didn't, so the girls stayed together
 in those days we were quite shy and cautious of one another not like it is today!
As we got older, we went out quite a lot as a group and enjoyed life, as most people do, but we knew our barriers (and what we could and couldn't get away with!) so we wouldn't go too far
My mother's sister had two sons much older than me
 The boys started going to listen to all sorts of music at gigs, and very kindly took me with them
 This was the beginning of my love for music
We had a curfew by which time we had to get home in the evenings, and let's face it, in those days you always had to do what your mother told you to do, whereas nowadays it is rather different!
i only wear one ring now, and that is my wedding ring
 i remember when Peter proposed
 We went out for a meal, which we tended to do, and we were with another couple who we were very close with
 This was, in fact, the couple that introduced us to each other, friends from the Navy
They decided that we would go for this meal and it was so strange because they chose a really posh place, which we'd never done before, always favouring something cheap and cheerful
 i thought: something must be up 
And then Pete asked me to marry him! He didn't get down on one knee, but it just surprised me that he did it in front of everybody
 We were having a meal and he just said 'l want to marry you, will you let me marry you? Then he produced the ring out of nowhere! it was strange really, because he was away a lot of the time, as anyone in the Navy is
 The worst was when he was away a year less a day, and that was hard
 i was lucky as i had friends in the same situation, and we all got together and we made the most of it
 All we had for near a year was letters to keep in touch
 I didn't really think about keeping them, but we should have done
 Then the children could have read what we were doing!
i was just getting my lunch ready when my husband, (who worked in the Navy), walked in the door
 He sat down with me to say that he had been asked to go to Hong Kong! The man originally selected to go had fallen and broken his arm and leg, and would my husband like to go in his place?
My initial reaction was, on my goodness! There I was, seven months pregnant with our first child and i thought No, Not doing it
 But then i thought, Well, if I don't do it I'll always regret it
 So we did it!
After talking with my husband, we decided that he would go to Hong Kong, and i would go to my mum's and follow after the baby was born
i was in hospital for a long time before the baby decided to arrive
 One day, i'd gone to a clinic for a checkup, to make sure everything was ok, as she was quite late, and they whooshed me off to hospital straight away and i was put in a bed! I stayed in hospital for three weeks, but it felt like three months!
i wasn't allowed to get out of bed, or do anything, because they thought the baby wasn't going to survive
 i was stuck in bed for a long, of course, long Pete time was before the baby arrived
 away, having just moved That was awful
 And ' out to Hong Kong! i was very worried
 in hospital I got bigger and bigger and bigger
 i was supposed to eat, but i was finding it really difficult
 it was hard, but we laugh about it now
 When i came out of hospital i was huge! I'd been stuck in bed for so long and they
stood over me and made sure that i ate and ate! The funniest part was when someone came in one day, and
walked past me, and i thought, I know that face who is it? Then he turned around and looked at me, and he came running across, and it was my husband's brother! He said, 'Did you realize my wife's in hospital?' 'No,' I replied
 Wasn't that funny, both of us in hospital, giving birth at the same time? Weird!
i didn't like being in hospital, it was dreadful
 Couldn't move, couldn't do anything
 i got fed up with reading books and magazines, and they didn't have televisions in those days
 Just stuck there
 But we got through it, and Pete did finally see his baby
it was about two months afterwards when I went out to Hong Kong
 He met me from the plane and the expression on his face when he saw his baby daughter for the first time was magical
 He rushed to see me, and then saw this little face and it was, 'Look what We got! What do i do with it!' it was a shock, but a lovely surprise
 The pace of life in Hong Kong was really busy and frenetic
 Everything was fast and furious! The only place of peace and quiet that we ever found was round the back of the island there was an area where nobody lived, with a beautiful beach, and you just took your swimming gear and it was wonderful
 The rooms we had were superb  really high with fantastic views of the city
 We were there for two years, and got to know people very easily and had great fun with everyone, including our new daughter! During our time there we had several holidays in China, and loved the people, as well as enjoying finding new places to go
Whilst we were out there we asked my mother (who was a lovely lady, albeit not very well travelled), 'Would you like to come?' 'Oh no, no, i can't do it, it's too much,' was the reply
 i said 'it's entirely up to you, but if you want to, you can come
' And eventually she decided she would do it
 She did it on her own, she came all the way to Hong Kong, and she thought it was wonderful
She stayed with us for a month, and everyone made such a fuss of her, because at that time she was the only relative that had some out to visit
 An added bonus was it meant she could look after my daughter for me, and I could go out! it was the first time she had ever been abroad, and i never dreamt she would come  but she did! She must have been amazed at the contrast of Hong Kong to Rugby, Warwickshire
The two years went very quickly, and we were soon back in England
 Two years later i had another girl, and life was really
One day, several years later, my husband came home from work and said he had been asked to go to Brunei, and take us with him
 Of course we said yes! Once you've done something like that, you get a taste for it
 it makes you want to go around and explore, and we have been to so many countries now, and seen so much of the world, (both in our time abroad and subsequently on our travels), that we would never have seen, or ventured to if we had never gone to Hong Kong all those years ago
 in Brunei we had a wonderful time
 School for the children was from amo'clock
 After that, the time was ours for the rest of the day! We used to spend many afternoons relaxing and swimming in the pool
 The children wanted to stay  they enjoyed it so much
 We were therefor We had a house to ourselves, two years, loving every minute of it
 a huge space to store everything in, it was wonderful
 There were so many of us from the Navy out there, that we all had a really good time
 i did miss England, because we'd been in England for such a long time, but we really enjoyed where we were, and what we were away doing
 i was concerned about to Brunei, one was four and the children and moving them one was eight when we first arrived, but they thoroughly enjoyed it
 We bought this plate in , our first year there
 Engraved on it is a mosque
 They have a lot of mosques, and they are beautiful buildings, and we enjoyed so much visiting them and taking in their culture
 To go to Asia in the 's was very exotic: there were few people from England that had even been to  Brunei, let alone move there! Nowadays everybody goes abrGoad, but people didn't in those days, or at least not very oftoenn Ur friends thought we were absolutely mad
 But if i hadn't gone with my husband i wouldn't have seen him for over a year! So for me there was no question
 It was decides  we've got to go and that's it!
To keep in touch with our parents and family we had to write letters, you couldn't do anything else much in those days it was just writing letters backwards and forwards
 I didn't keep any of the letters which is so stupid really
 I never even thought about it, I just though 'I've read that one', and it went in the bin! But I thought afterwards, we should have kept them
 The children would have appreciated them, but it was too late
 It was lovely to come back and see family, because that was the bit I missed the most: Family
Brunei was lovely, very calm
 We used to laugh in the evenings, because we would always go out after we had eaten a meal, and it was always men!
There were no women out at all
 It was always the men
 The women were at home of course, but a lot of the men would go out in the evenings, and then they'd see me and the girls coming, and they'd all stand to one side! It was so lovely, they were so respectful but also absolutely amazed to see women out
 They watched us wherever we went: we were a bit of a spectacle!
But you had to be very careful what you wore: you had to make sure you were covered up
 You had to be careful not to upset anybody
 They didn't insist that you covered everything up, but they insisted that if you went out after a meal, or just for a walk, you had to make sure that you were mostly covered, especially shoulders and legs
 And why not? This was their culture and their beliefs, and led to me acquiring a huge sarong collection! Sarongs covered everything, and all of us wore them because we knew they were safe' and the colours were beautiful
 Of course, because it was there and we could afford it, we brought a huge collection home with us!
The residents of Brunei were probably also not used to seeing many white women at the time, and it must have made a big difference to them, because the culture was very much that the women stayed at home all the time
 The only time we ever saw the women was right at the beginning of the day, when they would go and buy the food for the day, and then we would never see them again
 For us, it was really strange
 Whether it is still like this today or not, i don't know
 i imagine things will have changed quite a lot in the last thirtyodd years
Whilst we were out there we had a sailing boat
 The guys were used to boats anyway, so we just sat there good as gold while letting them do all the hard work! We bought the boat ourselves while we were out there, we could afford to do it, then
 it was lovely clear blue water
 Once you had gone through the break, it was like being in a different world
 The children were good, they were still fairly young, but they knew they had to behave themselves on the boat, and it was brilliant
Once you come out of Brunei, there are several sets of islands close by, so we tried to work our way round them all
 Every week we went somewhere
 Sometimes we stayed near the island, other times we went off and explored something else
We were out there for two and a half years, so we really got into it
 We had one of those great big hampers we would take with us, so the food was there for all day, a huge picnic! It was just wonderful
When we came back to the UK, we had a little boat, because we had enjoyed having the boat so much
 We didn't keep it for very long though, because there were just too many other things to do it became a bit much
The children did really well, it gave them a lot of confidence
 When they returned to school in England, we discovered they were ahead of the other children, and had to wait while the other children caught up! They hated it, but despite their protests they still went to school!
We loved being in both Hong Kong and Brunei, and learnt a lot from it
 We were very lucky to have had such an amazing
opportunity, and the children thrived
 They do make me laugh sometimes, because the children will suddenly say, Mummy, do you remember when we did such and such?' and i'm thinking, i can't remember that! There is so much i can't remember now but they can tell me the stories
When we first came home, the noise and busyness was so overwhelming
 It was always so peaceful in Brunei, and suddenly we were in the midst of it all again, but we got used to it
i don't know that i would go back to Brunei again it's a long time now since we were there, and if we did go i would perhaps be disappointed
 i don't know how it has changed, and i would rather leave it as it is in my memory
 They were good memories and even the girls can remember  and it's amazing how much they remember, even though they were so young
 My eldest daughter went off around the world after that with some friends, and it was, 'Bye, i'll see you in about two years' time! They had a wonderful time, and why not? That's what life's all about, isn't it?
it was always the smell at Christmas, not only the food which was always there
 it was the fact that the tree was there, and you had the smell of the pine needles
We always used to go to church (because we had to go to church) and I had to behave myself
My parents didn't have a lot of money so therefore even at Christmas we didn't get a lot
 But we had to make the best of it
 We had enough to have a tree and do a lovely meal, and all the family came and grandma came
We had a lot of things that were homemade, or that were handmedownsA
ll my clothes used to come from other people, and go back to other people! Because that was just how we lived
 But still i adored my mum, and one of my aunts was fantastic, too
 So i was very lucky, because I had a lovely family
i always have loved Christmas, and I still do! Every year i can't wait for it to be here
 My children adore it too, because they've got children of their own
Christmas to me was always very, very important
 Don't know why, but it was
 i loved doing everything towards Christmas, and i loved doing everything after it, too
Because we were away a lot of the time, we did Christmas in different countries across the world
 We still always got a roast dinner, though! In many ways, it was still very much like it would be in England, because most of the people there were english expats, but the weather was slightly hotter! I enjoyed every minute
of it, it was lovely
 in our family, everyone comes together at Christmas
 We
have the grandchildren on one table, and us on another
 it's quite crowded
 i said to my husband a long time ago, 'The children are going to stop coming for Christmas, they've got children of their own and their own families!' But every year, they say, 'We're all coming to you mum, is that all right?
Every year i'm thinking, So many to fit in! Of course, it gets very big
 My husband does the cooking
 i do the washing up: always have done, and always will do! My husband is more the cook out of the two of us
 I do cook, obviously, because i have to but he is the one that enjoys it, which is fine by me!
i think we have been very lucky because we have had a very good life
 And now the children are more than old enough to look after themselves, they have given us some wonderful grandchildren and it's been brilliant
 And the thing is they still want to come here and see us!
Just recently I thought that my grandson would probably never want to come and stay with us again, because he's getting older  he's twelve now  and he phoned up the other day and said, 'Nanny, I haven't come to stay with you for a long time,' and i said, 'Well, you know you can come whenever you want to,' and he said, 'Right  i'm coming tomorrow' it's lovely to think that he still wants to come
 And he brought his younger sister as well, she's eight
 But they are as good as gold
 We say, Where do you want to go today, what do you want to do?' And they say 'Nothing, Nanny, we just want to stay here with you!!'
i think it is because they live a busy life anyway they do a lot of things, school clubs and what have you, so actually to come and stay with us for a couple of days is a nice change
 My grandson is the one that makes me laugh, he is about a foot bigger than i am, huge, and he comes up to me, and i never dreamt that he would hug me by the age he is now, but he does
 He's at 'big school' now, and has been for quite a while, but he's just amazing
i find retirement lovely because we now have no responsibilities
 We just do whatever we want, whenever we want
to
 It's been like that for a long time now
 We fill our days with all sorts of things we enjoy eating very much, we've always enjoyed eating! (i think most people do these days)
 We like to go off and find somewhere nice to eat, We don't go so much in the evenings, probably a lot of people do but I'd rather go at lunchtime because i find it's just a little bit easier
 Otherwise you tend to think Come on, we've got to hurry, because you've got to be back for something, or someone else needs the table
 i find it less time constraining, and more relaxing at lunchtime
There was no question whatsoever that my mother was going to have a girl
 All the time while she was carrying me i was Ann
 And when i was born  stupidly  it became Antony
i don't like the name
 i don't remember anybody calling me anything other than Tony
When i did my carpentry apprenticeship at Thanet, one or two of the guys used to call me 'Ant'
 The Antony hasn't got an H in it either
 Anytime anybody said to me 'what's your name?' i would always reply 'Antony with no H'
 Always had to say that
 it was a pain being called that, really
i think the disappointment to my mother at me not being a girl did not die off until she died, really! i have often wondered how far i would have got if had been a girl
i was born in the tail end of , just as the war started
 We lived in Thanet, but there's nothing much in Thanet, except for the sea, which i loved as a child
 However, when i was a young chitd you could not get to the sea: there were defences all around the English coast during the war, with rolls of barbed wire on our beach
 You simply couldn't get onto the sands! I suppose they thought if they put up a roll of barbed wire the Germans wouldn't get in
 So there were no walks on the beach for me in my early days
We lived within about a mile and a half of Manston airfield
 That was a major RAF base at the time, as well as being a Battle of Britain base, so it all happened at Manston
 Most children from our area (WestgateOnSea)were evacuated during the war
 My little mate who i used to knock around with at the time was evacuated to Wales, and most of my other friends went to places further inland, too
 i suppose they thought they were safer
My cousin and his parents, who lived across the road from us, moved to Pluckley for several years during the war, and we were supposed to have gone with them, but my mother wouldn't
go
 My father worked at Manston airbase not in the forces, but
working for the maintenance team there, and, seeing as Manston was forever being bombed, he was forever putting up buildings again, and so my mother refused to go
 She wanted to stay with him, and that meant I wasn't going anywhere, either
Looking back on it now, it wasn't a brilliant idea
 If it had happened now, and it had been my children living within a mite and a half of an airfield that was suffering regular bombings,
they'd have gone! The end result, as far as i was concerned at the time, was that I didn't have that many friends left to play with
i can remember all around the Westgate area was full of bombsites, all over the place
 All the Thanet towns suffered a lot of bomb damage
 Whether they were aiming to hit the towns, or aiming for Manston airfield i'm not sure, but of course bombing was far less accurate then
 I can remember so many bomb damaged properties near where I lived, and we used to play on the bomb sites
 it wasn't anything that was unusual to us, the whole time I was a child they were always there, and we'd always
had them: readymade playgrounds
We had a shelter in the garden, dug by my father, who was good at practically everything (including building air raid shelters!)
That place was magical to me
 It was quite deep, with a mound over the top of it, and we were always playing down there as kids even if there wasn't a raid on!
I remember the shelter was also multipurpose: you could keep food down there, as you would in a fridge, because it was so cool
 People just didn't have fridges at the time (including us), so we kept our butter, bacon, eggs and what have you down the shelter
 We loved it down there as kids, and the shelter was still there when I left home, and when my mother moved out
 Who
knows, it may still be there today
A place i used to go to a lot growing up was Deal
 It used to
fascinate me because you could see the Goodwin Sands from
there, which is a sandbank about a mile or so out to sea
 They were always getting boats wrecked on the sands
 We used to go up there with our binoculars and see whether there were any new wrecks out on the sands
 That was something I used to really look forward to, and thinking, i haven't seen that one before!
There was a wreck right up on the beach  quite a big boat
 You would always think you could swim out to them, but really it was a bit too far
They have built a pier out there recently
 The old pier as far as I know was a traditional old pier, but it got rammed by a boat in the  or could have even been before then, and pretty well destroyed it
 When I first knew Deal, there wasn't any pier whatsoever there, it hadn't been rebuilt yet
 i don't know when they rebuilt it as the pier that is there today
i used to love going to Deal because shingle was a novelty, where i lived in Thanet there was only sand! i used to love making the pebbles growing, and seeing how many times I could make it bounce: Cor, i made it bounce ten times,' I'd shout, (and if you believe that you'll believe anything!)
We used to stay in St Alfred's Square, and just up the road they had a bakery, and you only had to come out of our front door and you could smell the bread
 i can almost smell and taste it now as I sit here
 Every day we would be up the road for fresh rolls in the morning
 I don't think they were actual relatives we stayed with, I think they were friends of my grandmother, but we termed them s relatives and had to give them a kiss like relatives!
My early childhood Christmases were spent throughout the Second World War
 Quite sparse, I probably never had even one new toy up until the age of five or six because they were just not available
My father was a carpenter so he used to make bi
ts and pieces
 I remember one big aeroplane i had that he made, i can see it now
 Times then just weren't easy there was just not much around, not for anyone
For Christmas dinner we had a chicken
 My grandfather on my father's side used to keep chickens and rabbits
 i didn't know at the time, but i guess one would have been selected for the table
My father had an allotment so we were alright for vegetables
 I have a feeling allotments came about in the First World War grow your own, etcetera
We always used to go to one of my grandmothers for Christmas dinner, which i didn't enjoy that much
From a very early age I was what I call dragged' over to my grandmother's, really against my will, when i'd sooner be at home playing with my toys
 instead of that, i was at my grandmothers, playing with nothing! I didn't really enjoy going over to that particular grandmother's
 There was nothing wrong with her, it was just boring for a child
We always had a Christmas tree, although heaven only knows where it came from
 it used to appear  i think Santa used to bring it  down the chimney! (it is amazing it wasn't covered in soot
) i suppose that is the magic of Christmas!
After the war it took a long time for everything to be rebuilt
 t guess Christmas presents got a bit better
 I had a lot of Hereby train sets
 The funny thing is, where we lived, we didn't have electricity
 it was Victorian, and obviously built before electricity was put into houses, ordinary terraced houses at any rate
  i didn't have things like electric train sets, because they were pointless
 The only thing i had was windup, clockwork stuff, and masses of Hornby
We had an open fire in the back room, with a back boiler to heat water, but of course in the summer that was not alight, so we were all boiling kettles
 it was just natural to us, bath times you had to light the fire! it seems archaic, doesn't it?
I can remember, particularly before we got electricity, the lamp in the ceiling of the back room we all lived in, with a yellow fringe shade, and what they called a bypass which meant there was a little tiny flame going all the time so we didn't have to get a match
 They had mantles which were very, very delicate things
 They were what gave you the light from the gas
 The gas would come down a pipe into mantles which were made out of some sort of silk i think, and these mantles produced the light from the gas
 That bypass was 'high tech' at the time
can't imagine that now! Butcan remember it
 i am sure a lot of other places had electricity by then, but you see my parents didn't own the house
Our next door neighbour who we used to call Aunty May, (she almost was my mother, she was always in the house), her brother
owned the house
 Then later, my grandfather died on my father's side, and my father inherited about two thousand quid (which was a smali fortune), and he put electricity in
 When we snally got electricity  it must have been a shock!
i was a carpenter by trade
 Didn't really want to be a carpenter i must be honest about it, but my father was a carpenter, his father was a carpenter and so forth
 My father had his own building business so it was assumed i would go into that
i really wanted to go into archaeology
 The reason for this was that i went to school in Canterbury, so i had to bus up and down from Thanet to Canterbury, and the whole top of the town in Canterbury was blitzed
 Almost nothing there at all
 When i first knew that part of Canterbury, by St George's Clock Tower, Marks  Spencers and our school were about the only things there! Well, part of our school was still there, but a lot of it was prefab buildings' which had been put up temporarily
Whilewas there, in , the government decided to lift the country out of its postwar depression and put on the Festival of Britain on the South Bank in London
 A lot of towns and cities around the country followed suit
 They had one in Canterbury, and they called it the Festival of Canterbury
Our school was at the top of the city centre, and everywhere surrounding the school was completely blitzed
 We used to walk to our school, and there were just basements full of weeds and buddleia and all manner of things that grow in basements
 So, in advance of the Festival of Canterbury, they cleared out a lot of the weeds to make way for the festival site
As they were clearing it out, we always used to go down
there as kids, and I became interested in what they were finding, and how they were going about excavating the site
They were mostly find everyday things that had been lost the shop that sold fruit and veg, or hardware, or whatever it may be all of a sudden was gone, and all the remnants left behind
 Just watching these guys, a lot of whom I guess were students, digging around with their trowels, fascinated me
i didnt pursue it because to seriously have a career in archaeology I would have needed to go to college or university, and in those days, my future was mapped out
 It was a bit in those days
 i was going to be a carpenter, and that was that
i am certainly not sorry i was a carpenter, because I got an apprenticeship with a very good local builder
What would my father have said if I had told him I wanted to do archaeology? You want to get a trade behind you, my son' This to some extent in those days was true
 You could leave school and work in a shop or something of the like, but if you actually had a trade, it was considered a good career, and something you could always fall back on
Although, even after having got my trade in carpentry, it I had gone back to my father and said Now can i do archaeology?' he probably would have replied You've got a good trade, what do you want to go and do that for?' He was a handson sort of man he didn't really understand
 He was always into tools and building and woodwork, as I am!
I have a large workshop in my garden full of tools and wood that keeps me busy
 I don't do so much out there now, but at one time I was always out there
 One of the joys of being in Canterbury therefore for me, ever
since I was a child, is that it has so much history
 Any time i walk through the town I can just spend hours looking
 The buildings are so interesting and varied, both historic and modern
I walk down the high street, and I'll never get tired at looking at the rooftops, especially in the older part of the city
 It is a marvelous place to be
What this marking gauge means to me is a connection to my heritage
it was used as an everyday tool by my ancestors, primarily my great grandfather, whose initials are engraved on it
 it was so ordinary to him, something he would have picked up, held and used, and put down again every day
 Nothing special
 However to me, because of this, it holds great sentimental value
A marking gauge was used to mark a straight line on wood, prior to sawing it
 it is a tool which you can adjust, and the line on wood is made by a metal point, which you then cut (or saw) to
 it's made of beech wood, and looks very well used  yet it's still functional
I imagine my great grandfather would have used this probably in the , and the gauge itself could possibly even be older than that, because we don't know if it was bought new or second hand (with the initials engraved later)
The working face of the gauge has two brass inserts, and one of these is well worn with use
 For some strange reason you always used them in your left hand,can't really think why, now it comes to it, but we were always taught to use them in our left hand
Not knowing my great grandfather, the person this tool reminds me of is my grandfather
My grandfather only had the sight of one eye, and one eye was closed all the time
 He used to hair about Westgate on a bicycle, andam sure he couldn't see where he was going! He was the most peculiar sight,should think
He was obviously quite a clever man, and a very good carpenter, I know
When he moved to Westgate he bought what then became known as Pinkney's Yard' on Belmont Road in WestgateOnSea, and there he had workshops, which you accessed from the Belmont Road
 in between the workshops were a lot of lockup garages, and a big open garage
Visitors used to use them in the summer a lot, especially the open garage
 My father brought me down there, because they had
?
to move cars about for people to get their car out
 As quite a young lad,was actually driving cars and moving them all about a bit
 And that was Pinkney's Yard!
it's not there now, there are houses built there now
 Originally the lockup garages were stables (before motor vehicles were about) and i can remember a manger being there too, a remnant from those early days
My grandfather would have used this marking gauge too, in the early th century
 When you think he and my great grandfather actually got hold of this tool more than a hundred years ago, measured a distance and out to it, to me that is something quite special
Marking gauges are still used now, and my antique (with a bit of tweaking) was of such good quality when it was first made, that it could still be used today
it was the s, andwas on the committee of the Rendezvous Club at Dreamland Ballroom, in Margate
There were two dancehalls at Dreamland, both very popular with young people, and they used to attract a lot of famous people
 We ran what they used to call the Rendezvous Club, which was a Sunday night dance club
Public Sunday night dancing was illegal in those days, and if you wanted to go dancing it had to be something private: by forming a club, it became private
 We would register two, three, or four hundred people in a night, who of course then became members' of the club, so it was then legal
remember leaning against the side of coffee bar and chatting to Mick Jagger, watching a group called The Barron Knights, who were another popular group in those days
 We had all the big music names of the time, that most people have forgotten about now
 The Tremolos used to come down a lot, i knew them quite well
 They made the big time eventually
saw so many people who became stars, or celebrities, and thought nothing of it
 it was just day to day life I didn't think of getting autographs
The Thanet music scene was very lively then people used to come down from London sometimes to play and absorb the music scene
 Those were the days!never met the Beatles, which i was always rather sorry about
 The Beatles did come down to Thanet, but i never actually met them
 But practically every other big group
of the time (late ' and 'GOs) i met! i used to play as well
 i played guitar in one or two of the pubs
in Thanet
 i played whatever was current at the time
 i mainly leant towards country music, but when you look at the big stars of the time, Elvis Presley, Dolly Parton, Dusty Springfield, their style was
basically country based
 A perk was that it also was quite popular with the girls: i used
to DJ in dreamland a couple of nights a week as well
 That could lead to anything! Ali the girls used to flock up on stage and the stories that followed  i'll keep for my memories only!
They were good times
 I enjoyed playing, but i let it go for years and years
 i have picked up a guitar since, but i can't do anything like i used to, and then it gets frustrating
 You have to
use it or lose it
 With it being a Sunday night dance club, it had to be non
profit making
 All the money went back into the club
 What we used to do was build up a few thousand, and then put a free night on, and try and get a really good group booked
 i can honestly remember putting The Rolling Stones on for nothing
 Mick Jagger was reasonably local, from Kent, and was often around
i remember seeing The Rolling Stones for the first time on stage, and thinking how scruffy they were! Groups then all wore suits, and The Stones came on, and i thought, they are never going to get anywhere! They had a scruffy, dirty look  but the girls went potty for them! They'll never get anywhere'  that was my prediction so never take any notice of anything i predict!
was already married at the time, not that happily married i must say: she didn't want children ever
 That's a big decision, and it was something that hadn't sunk in for me at the time
 i just thought, so what! But i shouldn't have married her i knew i shouldn't have married her
The other thing was she never really left home
 i wouldn't like to blame her for that because it was possibly partly my fault as well, who knows? i only see my side of it
We never bought anywhere together we lived in a rented property down in WestgateOnSea
 it wasn't a brilliant marriage
 She was always, always, always at her mother's
 it seemed to run in the family, because her mother was like that as well
 Her mother's mother lived two doors away she might as well have lived with her, honestly
 Everybody flocked to Grandmother's
 it wasn't ideal
At that time i'd been involved in a motorcycle business, and we also used to do garden machinery, servicing them, so i was very well up with small engines, two stroke engines and things like that
 saw an advert in the paper for Riceman's, in Canterbury (which later became Fenwick's)
 They'd got a gardening department and wanted to expand it considerably, and they wanted somebody who was well up on garden machinery and engines to do both selling and servicing, as they had workshops in Dover Street
i went for the interview and it must have been the personnel manager, somebody else, and the third person sitting in on the
interview (because he was well in with the Ricemans) was a guy called Graham Rainer, and he was chief buyer for menswear
 i don't why he was at the interview, but i think he sat in on most interviews for staff there
 He and Jonathan Riceman used to go drinking together
They said to me, We'd like you to start, but we haven't quite got everything in place yet
 if you'd like to get used to the company workings and everything, you can come and work on menswear for a month or so'
  i thought, OK, although I wasn't interested in menswear, not at all
 Having said that i am glad i did it, as i got well into retail
 The whole experience turned out to be very interesting
 i was working on menswear, and Hazel (now my wife) was one of two on the switchboard at Riceman's
As part of Hazel's job, when the post came in she had to sort the letters out and bring them round to the departments
 She used to walk into our department at least once a day
Oh my God, she was so attractive! She really was
 There was always a bit of a winkwink, nudgenudge' between us lads
 She had lovely brunette hair, she always got noticed
 She used to walk in every day
When you are in a store like that with so many employees, you tend to sort of form cliques
 You go to lunch and dinner together with the same people, who go at the same time as you, so you sit with them and what have you, and that is really how i got to know her
 She was a stunner
 Eventually my marriage broke up, and we had kids, and then grandchildren!
i had a Volkswagen Beetle
 The nearest Volkswagen dealer in those days was in Sturry, and I was booked in for a job or a service or something
A friend of mine had a bit of a haulage business and i used to drive for him sometimes, on an odd job basis
 The night before I was due to take my car in for service, i had been to Southampton in his lorry
i took the lorry there and back again, got an hour's kip on the settee, and set the alarm, got up and took my car to the garage in Sturry
 and didn't make it
 i got a mile from home and on the dual carriage way coming into Birchington, i went straight up the back of a steam roller? i must have just dozed off, there was no other reason for it
 The car was in good nick, there was no reason other than i was tired, and I wasn't concentrating
i banged myself up quite a lot
 i thought I had lost my right eye
 There is a bit of a scar there, it doesn't look much now but at the time when that bandage came off, I could see, oh boy, my poor looks! I was off work for a long time i'd cracked a couple of ribs and all sorts of things
I was going out with my (now) wife at the time, and I wasn't able to work for a long time
 Hazel's mum was doing some fruit picking at a farm called Neil's Place
 The guy who she was working for, who managed the farm, was ever such a nice bloke, and she must have been talking about me and the fact that i was getting better, and possibly could do something again and he said
'I could do with a hand up here
' He wanted someone who could drive the tractor and pick up all the bobkins full of fruit
 I had never been on a tractor in my life but I gave it a go and i really loved it
I really enjoyed being out and i was interested in ail the trees and the fruit  they grew apples, pears, a little soft fruit like raspberries and gooseberries
 Mostly apples and pears
 There were some plums but they had let them go
 I absolutely loved it
 The owner had only just bought the place, it used to belong to Mounts, who were one of the big fruit growers in the area, and it
was one of their old farms, all their old trees, seventy or eighty years old perhaps
The guy who bought it said he wanted to completely grub everything out and replant it
 So when the fruit picking was done, Peter, the manager there, who i was working for, said would i like to stay and help him with this? So I stayed on there and we grubbed all the old trees out and planted loads of new stuff: I expect some of my planting is still up there!
i liked it so much, but i couldn't go anywhere there  it was a very small place
 Then i saw an advert for fruit growing at Chartham Hatch, with a big fruit grower
i went for it and they sent me on courses and all sorts
 i got well into it and really, really enjoyed it
 Eventually I went out on my own, selfemployed as a contractor, pruning mostly
At fruit picking time i would go and find a job driving, mostly, or running a gang of fruit pickers
 it is quite a demanding, busy job running a gang of  to  fruit pickers because you have to get what you are picking absolutely right, because what you're picking
goes into store
 it could be put away in September and might come out in February, March time, so it has to be pretty good
 You don't want to store a load of rubbish and then chuck half of it away!
We also used to prune in the summer, but for different reasons
 Most of my year was spent pruning, except in the picking season
 Sometimes I would take a holiday for two or three weeks in the picking season, sometimes i would get a job running fruit picking gangs
i was in this business for many years, and i more or less ended my working life with fruit! That is what I enjoyed doing, out in the fresh air
 The one thing i didn't like was rain, and i still don't like it
 it is just one of those things that, if you are going to do a job like that, you have to accept that, sometimes, you are going to get wet
i didn't really have a set date when i would retire i sort of wound it down really in my sixties
 Not sure when i actually stopped
 i was a carpenter by trade, and i was always interested in antiques, so then i did a course at one of the colleges in Canterbury in antique restoration
 i stili do the odd bit, but not too much nowadays
The teacher was an absolutely brilliant restorer
 He was based at Deal, and I used to go out there quite often, and he gave me work
 I really enjoyed doing that and i still do really, I still do bits and pieces
 Hazel does a few boot fairs during the year and if i do something up i sell them through that
 By and large i don't make a lot, but i enjoy doing it
I have never been any happier than being here, where I am now, in my house in Rough Common, on the outskirts of Canterbury
 I love being outdoors, and I'll never get tired of the view from my garden, looking down the hill over Canterbury and the surrounding countryside
Of course, it changed from season to season
 You see the trees change colour and come autumn, the line of trees my garden overlooks turns a shad of golden, which is just beautiful
 Unfortunately, this also signs the onset of winder and the being of (often) nonstop, pouring rain
!
people got to know of their existence
 He was straight on the phone to my inlaws, You want to come and see this site!' My fatherinlawcame down, and thought, yes, this would suit me fine! And he had his pick of the plots, the best one of which he bought before they'd even started building them
i love it here, especially when we have animals in the field just beyond my garden
 Sheep, mostly, although we have had pretty well all farmyard animals over the ten years
 When i first knew the house, there were always pigs out here, giving rise to the field being known as the pig field'
 They were smashing
 They used to come up to fence and let you scratch their heads
 Of course, all the houses that backed onto the field used to chuck titbits over for them, which meant they used to get quite friendly to us, and it was lovely having them here
The field was owned by butchers at the time, so unfortunately the pigs never stayed long!
Dementia
 The only difference for me really, is my memory
 i can't think there is any other difference  but then, maybe that's the dementia!
i can remember things from way back (you know, , when i was quite young!) However more recent things, i can't remember
it's not all the time, and it's not terrible there is nothing terrible about it
 i just tend to forget things
 Everybody forgets things, but i forget more than maybe you, the reader at home would
When i got given the diagnosis, I was shocked
 In fact shocked is not the word
 That particular word  dementia  to me has a terrible sound about it: demented
 Demented
For someone to say to me 'You have dementia' to me implied 'you are demented!' That wasn't at all nice
 if it is somebody who is obviously used to talking about it and using the word, like social workers, doctors, then that is just a word that they use! But for me receiving it, it was not the same at all
 it was upsetting
i didn't find it hard to speak to my family and tell them
 They possibly had noticed my memory was getting worse, so perhaps it was not a massive shock to them
They have been supportive, but i don't think they have had to support me much more since I got the diagnosis, life has just carried on as far as i can see
i have a writeon calendar which i always use to write
anything important on, that helps my memory a lot
 i don't really have a routine, other than i love walking the dog every morning, and t go to Folkestone to see my daughter every Tuesday
 Apart from that, the day comes and goes as it will
 i spend a little time in the garage where i have a workshop, go into Canterbury, do the shopping
 indeed, these are activities i enjoy, regardless of dementia or not
Since i got the diagnosis, I think i am the same person
 i don't think my personality has changed, although other people might be the judge of that
 The only thing that has changed
(as far as i am aware) is my memory has got worse
 But again, it is important to stress that it is not terrible
 With the aid of my calendar, and my family, i can manage it
 i have the ForgetMeNots who indeed are a good support
I get more out of my family than anything, and my dog
 My eldest daughter works in Essex, and is very busy working in retail, and seldom around
 So, although i live with my eldest, I don't really see much of her
 i see more of my youngest who lives in Folkestone, more than any of them
i know I am certainly not going to get better, but i don't feel as if I am getting worse
 It doesn't seem that way to me
 If I am, it is very, very slow
i don't fear for the future
 i don't think there is anything i can't
do now, that i could do ten years ago! Driving is the one change of course, but generally speaking i don't miss it
 Only very occasionally do i miss driving
 I have always driven a small Vauxhall Astra van, and sometimes i will think, l wish had my van
with me,' but not very often
 My licence came up for renewal, and i had to have a driving test and i just thought, I cannot be bothered! i think for me, it was the right decision
There is a bus stop just up the road from me, i walk up to the bus stop and enjoy that
 it's something to do
i like travelling on the bus, you see things you never realised were there when you were driving (especially from the top deck!) and meet people you would never usually meet otherwise
 it's a novelty in a way, having spent so many years without going on buses at all
 i find it is far more relaxing, travelling by bus
i tend to read
 i don't have the problem of forgetting what We read so far, as a lot of what i read is factual, or autobiographical  i don't read a lot of fiction
 I am just sorting some books out now
 I have a very large collection, which i am trying to cut down
 If i read all of them i'd probably need to live to be !
For me, a relaxed, easy going approach is absolutely the best way to tackle dementia
 There is no use getting hetup about it it's there! And if anybody asks me, Do you feel as if you've got dementia?' i say no!
Having spoken at conferences from the perspective of a person with dementia, I think it is important that each of us will first give you a sense of who we are as people, before briefly describing our dementia experience and then our engagement and empowerment through our ForgetMeNot network in East Kent
My name is Keith Oliver
 I am married, with three grown up children and three grandchildren, and have lived in the Canterbury area for thirtythree years
 Until April Sf, i was head teacher of a very large primary school, was studying for an MA, and was advising other Canterbury schools on behalf of Kent County Council
 All that stopped with my diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at the age of fiftyfive
After devoting five months to my dementia assessment, and then five more months to come to terms with that, i decided that I needed to continue to try and play a useful role in society and utilized some of the skills which, although waning a little, were still available to me, in order to raise awareness about what living well with dementia is really like
Quickly, i was offered a voluntary role of Dementia Envoy' within the Kent and Medway NHS Social Partnership Trust, and then i became a very busy person
 Soon, I felt a greater impact could be had if others shared carrying the baton with me
 Consequently in November , six people with dementia and
two clinical psychologists met to form what professionals called a Dementia Service User Network,' but which we insisted should be titled the ForgetMeNots
'
The group has grown to involve eighteen people with dementia, with support from six Kent University students on placement with the Trust, and our monthly meetings are cochaired by two clinical psychologists and myself
The function of the group is partly social comradeship and partly to be a useful resource to the NHS Trust in the area
 The meetings last two hours and are a mix of structure to allow everyone with dementia the opportunity to contribute to the business, and informal during the break times
 Both MJ
 Saints and Chris N will talk about some of our projects, but four regular elements within our commitment are being on interview panels for posts connected to dementia care, where we bring a unique perspective and assessment on the candidate, not as a professional, but as a person we analyze and comment upon dementia related literature being generated by the NHS (the good, the bad and  yes, at times  the ugly documents), the British Psychology Society and other agencies prior to publication we have participated in a number of worthwhile projects with DEEP and are active supporters of this very important venture we speak at conferences and at postdiagnosis groups where often people in the audience have not long been diagnosed and are coming to terms with this, and welcome hearing our experience and positive
advice
 Last week i spoke at the Dementia Market Place event in
Canterbury, and wrote the talk the day that my mother had died she had Alzheimer's, too
The group is attracting a lot of attention within Kent, the UK and beyond, and is consequently being increasingly called upon
 i was delighted to recently announce at the launch of Kent's Dementia Action Alliance, as part of our Dementia Friendly Community initiative, that a West Kent satellite has been set up based here in Maidstone
i would now like to hand over to M
 J
 Saints, my fellow ForgetMeNot
Good afternoon
Today is the th of May, 
 We are in Maidstone, Kent
 Our Prime Minister is David Cameron, and the Leader of the
Opposition is Edward Milliband
After having given these answers to several GPs over a couple of years, a very kind locum listened to me when i said that i was having problems with memory, especially relating to language
 She sent me to the Sarre Memory Clinic at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Margate
 I'm very thankful to her!
At this clinic i was given various tests and a brain scan
 in May , i was diagnosed with vascular dementia
 The clinics! psychologist who gave me the tests was excellent and very supportive during this process
After that, i went to meetings in Whitstable with a group of people with the same disease, but found it very difficult as the
The first was in a group (We called ourselves the Happy Wanderers, which was quite apt) and the second course was on a onetoone basis
 On conclusion of the cognitive stimulation therapy in April this year, I joined the ForgetMeNots Group where i'm very much the 'newbie'
 In order of time within the ForgetMeNots Group, the three of us on stage today are very much like the Three Bears
 Keith is Papa Bear, M
 J
 Saints is Mamma Bear and I am Baby Bear
 Goldilocks is working the slide presentation! i have found being part of the ForgetMeNots Group very stimulating it is good to exchange thoughts and views with my peers on numerous subjects surrounding dementia and coping mechanisms
 Since joining the group in April, I have been involved in four projects and there will be two more before the end of the month
 The group certainly gets us out and about!' One of the group's recent projects, which started in April, is a Life Writing Group
 This is a Unique project in the United Kingdom which is being funded by DEEP (Dementia Engagement and Empowerment Project)
 We meet at The Beaney House of Art and Knowledge in Canterbury, a venue which is being provided free by Kent County Council
 The Life Writing Group is a six session course which is a fun and easy way of celebrating our life experiences, both past and present
 The aim is to record them in an enjoyable way for the participants and for others to then later share
 The idea is to publish them, the publishing costs being funded by the Alzheimer's Society
 The course is being supported and led by the author, Liz Jennings
 There are about ten of us taking part and we are greatly supported and aided, almost on a onetoon basis, by psychology students
 They also help out at the main ForgetMeNots Meetings, so they are no strangers to us
 At each session, we record these experiences by use of poetry and prose and we have already had two extremely enjoyable sessions
Subject matters that we are investigating over the six sesSionsare:
As with the main ForgetMeNots Group, i find this very stimulating and the feeling of friendship and community goes a long way to reassure all our group members that they are not alone in the strange and sometimes confusing world of dementia
Thank you for your interest and attention today and I will now hand you back to the capable hands of my fellow speaker, Keith Oliver
We hope that has given you a sense of some of the achievements by Kent ForgetMeNots,the group of people with dementia who we have spoken on behalf of today
We are closely allied to the aims and aspirations of the DEEP
network, many of which we have outlined today with Steve Milton
 i am reminded of two stories  one around my weekly visits to
a local primary school to hear children read
 Lewis, who is nine, recently said to me, l saw you in a magazine at my Doctor's'
He was right as my story had been covered in a NHS magazine in Kent, and I quite expected to become involved in a deep conversation with this bright lad about living with dementia, so I answered, Did you, Lewis?'
He smiled, and said Yes, and i know your first name!' Clearly the article  about not being defined by one's dementia  worked on this occasion! The second story comes from Along The Way,' the joint autobiography of actor Martin Sheen and his son, Emilio Estevez
 i have enormous respect for Martin Sheen, as both an actor and a man, and this story is one which i often use in my talks to illustrate how I feel about speaking publicly about living well with dementia:
i hope that you agree with the sentiment that everything the three of us have shared with you today is worth fighting for, despite the occasional scars
At our meeting last week, we talked about people who have inspired us
 The doctor! clinical psychologist who shares the chair with me without hesitation said that it is the members of this group who inspire her
 I hope that what we've shared with your today will Inspire you
As a group, we've spoken about the legacy of this collection: as ever, these writers yearn for greater impact than their own personal pleasure or satisfaction
They tong for others to live well, as they are trying to do themselves,
i think there's a lot to he said for writing for personal pleasure and satisfaction: it does you a tot of good
 Just last night, i was troubled by something that had happened in the day, and, at midnight, gave up trying to steep and came to sit at the kitchen table and pour all my thoughts onto paper, knowing that rest would follow the release
How about you? Yes have your own stories  and if you don't tell them, how wiil your loved ones hear them?
The great thing about life writing is that there's no right or wrong, simply your version of events, as you remember experiencing it
 it's your chance to tail your side of the story
With this in mind, we thought it would be nice to end the book with a few writing exercises that you are welcome to try
 To get the most out of them, i'd really recommend doing them in company, and then sharing your results something magical happens when you share your writing with others, taking the time to listen to each other and grow in understanding one another
We hope you'll enjoy them, and we wish you every success as you, like us, seek to live well, whatever life throws at you
Capture A Moment At the top of a blank page, write the words ' never forget the time I Set a kitchen timer again, just for five minutes this time, and continue the sentence
Something Special Choose an object that's really special to you and write about it with your trusty kitchen timer set for three minutes
Photo Finish Choose a photograph from an album you have at home
 Spend a couple of minutes really looking at it, and jot down thoughts that come to mind as you do
 You might like to list your thoughts in a particular order, and create a poem, or, alternatively, get that kitchen timer back out again and write for sve minutes about the photo you've chosen
 What senses does it reignite? Are there smells, sounds, or physical sensations that come to mind as you look at it?
Put yourself on the map At the end of this book, you'll have noticed photos of maps with handwriting on
 These are from our fourth session, The World We Seen
' If you'd like to create your own litemap, i discovered you can snd some very reasonably priced ones at a high street discount stationer's store! Lay the map out, and then write all over it  anything at all that comes to mind with arrows pointing to the locations where your memories took place
 You might enjoy doing the  over a cup of something nice, and sharing some of your experiences from around the world in the process
Happy writing!
If you've enjoyed the writers' works contained in this collection, and would like to read more, search for the ForgetMeNots on Amazon where we have a volume of additional writings, Life Goes On, which is available to downloadm
