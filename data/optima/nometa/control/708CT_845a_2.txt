 well on the left-hand side somebody is the little boy at the top of a ladder which is just falling over is taking something which presumably is something he shouldn't take and giving it to the little girl and on the right-hand side is the lady who is doing the washing up who presumably is the mother of the two children 
 oh yes er she's she's filled the washbasin too full of water which is now out all over the floor
