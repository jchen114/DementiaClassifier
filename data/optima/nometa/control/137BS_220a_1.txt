 looks like a little disaster area in the kitchen actually the housewife is drying up but she's got the sink overflowing and the shoes are on the little boy has gone up to the top cupboard and he's taking out cakes giving them to his sister the lid is come off he's standing on a stool which is about to topple over and the window is open through the sash and it looks out onto a garden and onto another building and another window and there's hedges and tree in the background there's no other things on the unit in the kitchen except a couple of cups and a large plate and nothing else in the cupboard except for the biscuit tin or cake tin which the little boy has taken the cakes out of and opened the cupboard door and i think that's it a little bit of a disaster area.
