 ah there's that house well m= mother is washing up and she's apparently not realising that the taps have been on and the sink is flowing over and she's getting her feet wet and a child has climbed up on a stool to get some biscuits out of a tin but he's tipping the stool over  
 and the girl is saying please can I have one and he's handing her one unaware that he's about to fall backwards because the stool's tipping over and 
 well snow on the  windows but i don't think that it is
