 it's a lot of accidents in the kitchen 
 the tap's running over on the sink mother's doing the dry= drying up and apparently oblivious window is open curtains drawn back children are raiding the sweet tin above the boy about to fall off the stool um .. I wonder if the sweet tins are buns um and a path in the front outside there's a garden  um what else ?
 two two cups and a plate on the side 
 whereas all the cupboards are tidy'ish
