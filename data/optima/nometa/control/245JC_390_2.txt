 it's a picture in the kitchen with things going wrong.. mum has left a tap running in the sink and it's all splashing while she dries a plate meanwhile.. son and daughter are rew=.. while she's got her backs turned to them are going into a food tin he's having to stand on a stool to reach up to it and is handing something down to her to the sister who's standing on the floor and the stool is tipping up and is going to fall over any minute
