 mother's drying up
 flood in the kitchen there's water from the sink there's the boy pinching cakes out the cupboard and handing them down to the little girl
 the stool's tilting so she may be putting her hand up to help him
 that's all that's happening there's a lot of things in there but actually happening is er
 the girl with her hand up and her finger against her mouth the boy on a stool which is  overbalanced 
 getting the cakes out of the cupboard  the woman's wiping a plate the sink's overflowing
 and there's no animals in it
  she's looking through the closed window at the  at the outside world plus curtains to the window
