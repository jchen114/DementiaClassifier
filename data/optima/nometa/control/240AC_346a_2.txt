 er.. someone's getting something out of a refrigerator and they're falling over.. where's the other one she doing? she's washing the dishes.. and it's over the sink's overflowing is that enough?
 er.. what el= what else is there?
 she's asking to have something out of the fridge i think they're pinching the children are pinching buns out of cakes out of the fridge 
 and quite rightly he's going to fall over and hurt himself that'll teach him to steal
