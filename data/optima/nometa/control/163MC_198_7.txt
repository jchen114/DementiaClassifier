 oh right mummy is drying a dish and she's obviously oblivious of the tap still you know water's still running
 and oblivious of the fact that behind her her little boy i presume it's her little boy has climbed onto a stool and it's falling over and he's trying to get a cake out of a tin and his sister is holding her hand out to receive the cookie whatever it is i should think it's spring time it looks like this 
 the window's open
