 chaos 
 a child is very stupidly standing on a stool to get some buns out of a tin and giving one to his little sister who is obviously encouraging him hes about to fall over nobody seems to mind mothers got her back to the children and isnt particularly interested in whats going on because shes not thinking about the washing up because shes put the tap on and the sink is overflowing and her feet are already getting wet but she doesnt seem to notice it at all er shes trying to dry up a plate but shes not concentrating
 got some soap powder in the sink i think and the windows open
 and theres a garden outside
