 yes um it's a kitchen scene with the mum drying dishes she's unaware that she's left the tap running i presume she's unaware of it um the window's open so probably it's a nice day it looks out onto the garden the little boy is standing on a stool trying to reach up into a tin of cookies and he's toppling over his presumably his sister is reaching out to the hand to receive one of the biscuits um
