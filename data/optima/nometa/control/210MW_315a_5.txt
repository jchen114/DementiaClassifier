 right weve got a kitchen scene and a disaster with er I dont know why mother is not paying attention to what shes doing but the water is flowing over from the sink onto the floor and all around her feet er shes supposed to be washing up but I dont think she is and the children are having fun the boy is going to fall off that stool while he pinches er cakes or cookies lets say from the top cupboard er his sister is aiding and abetting outside is a typical garden and it looks as though the bottom of the window is open its a very tidy kitchen theres nothing on the surfaces much except what shes actually doing which is quite unusual
