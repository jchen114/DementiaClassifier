 i seem to recognise this one 
 somebody's busy er washing up and er lose their concentration 
 leave the tap running and the sink overflows maybe it's because they are being distracted by the boy who's climbed up on a stool and is about to have an enormous crash because he's trying to steal something from the top shelf and a small girl is hoping to get something given her but she may not get it 
 is that enough ?
