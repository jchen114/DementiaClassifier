 oh the dear lady washing up  yes
 so what do you want me to do tell you whats wrong with it 
 well shes washing up and the waters overflowing and going all over her feet the children are climbing dangerously on a stool which is falling over while they take cookies from the tin in the cupboard shes got er the windows wide open to a garden there are two cups and a plate er shes right handed because shes wiping with her right hand .. its a very bare looking kitchen isnt it
 shes taking absolutely no notice of the children .. think thats about all
