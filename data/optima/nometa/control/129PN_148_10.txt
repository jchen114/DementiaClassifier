 I remember that one off i go 
  a little boy  taking things out of a bin at the top and handing them to his sister and the  stool he's on is falling over and his sister has his left hand up to catch it and she's also pointing at her mouth and saying shush with her finger and the mother is um  water splashing over the basin she she doesn't  over that and she's wiping dishes and there's a view out onto the garden the curtains are slightly pulled and there are other things on the er shelf  and er that's about it really.
