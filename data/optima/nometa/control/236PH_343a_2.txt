 well little boy is pinching .. cakes out of a tin and handing them a little girl who's saying shh don't tell mum mum is pretending she doesn't know what's going on and she's oh dear she so doesn't know that the tap's run over the sink's um run over she's doing the washing up she's actually I think gazing into the future
 and the little boy's about to fall off the stool.. 
 i don't think much else is happening quite enough
