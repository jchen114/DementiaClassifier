  thank you a lady's washing up and the water's spilling over the sink because she hasn't turned the tap off.. .. the boy's taking a bun out of a tin standing on a stool which is falling over so he's in some trouble.. girl looking a bit worried  her hand up to her mouth.. I'll put my glasses on  see the rest
 ..well is that it really .. the boy's got a bun already in his hand.. lady's drying the dishes I said that didn't I 
 I don't see anything else
 I thought you were going to ask me to colour it in
