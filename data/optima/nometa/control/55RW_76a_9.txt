oh yes your family haven't got up to much have they
 well we've got what looks like a mother and two children a boy and a girl the boy is standing on a three three legged stool reaching for buns in the cupboard  falling over and  the mother's not seeing what's going on because she's washing up doesn't even see water is overflowing the sink she's drying a plate and looking outside at the garden  there's a curved path going to a back gate   there are curtains up and a bush  tops
