 oh yes
 oh crikey yes
  this is a kitchen in which safety is not a priority 
 um theres a little boy up on a stool handing out muffins to a little girl and hes falling off the stool his socks are falling down 
 and mother presumably or older sister has got her back to them and shes at the kitchen sink and the sink is overflowing and the windows open so that people could fall out of it and shes um the the waters spilling onto the floor and um er um well there are two cups and a plate on the side and shes drying up a plate
 and those are the things that you were wanting me to notice ? 
 mm
 funny i have a sort of feeling that it it was a competition to see what all the all the safety factors were
  funny its not that really is it ?
 but thats how I looked at it yeah 
 anyhow carry on
