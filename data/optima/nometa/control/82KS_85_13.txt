 many times
 um there's a young lad he's on a stool which is in the means of falling over trying to get some cakes out of the cupboard in a cake tin 
 er handing the cakes to his sister which is stood next to him and there's a woman at the sink wiping up um there's the tap's on in the sink and the water's overflowing onto the floor from the sink the window's open er there's an outlook of the garden
