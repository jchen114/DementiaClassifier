 well someone's washing up and someone's taking something out the cupboard and the water's overflowing not much else to say
 the stool's falling over the kid's going to fall and break his neck in a minute she's going to get flooded out um he's taking cakes out the tin 
 who else is in the picture there's two children  
 the girl  reaching up for something reaching up to take something off the boy the lady's washing up the water's flowing out the sink can't see anything else in there
