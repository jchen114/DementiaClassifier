 oh yes  
 i would colour this you know
 its like the sort of thing you had in in you know colouring books when i was a child 
 yes well its a mother who is obviously not on the ball at all her mind is far away shes thinking shes washing up but shes not really because shes about to get drowned in the overflowing sink she hasnt thought about leaving the taps on and theyre running all over the place but shes got a nice um sort of tap i want and combines the hot and the cold 
 ive got  taps shes done a bit of washing up because shes got some um two cups here perhaps shes waiting to do the cups and a plate on the side there shes by a window that looks out onto a bit of garden but the picture doesnt show very much about it theres some something growing and a bush and a tree and another window the windows wide open its fairly windy i should think from the look of it curtains tied back and the children are making merry hell with the biscuit tin
