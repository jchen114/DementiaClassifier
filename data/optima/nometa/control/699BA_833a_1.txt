 oh this a delightful picture it's a picture of english family life as imagined by some absolute lunatic
 the woman hasn't got a dishwasher so she's washing up she hasn't turned off the tap so that the water is over-running onto the floor now then all 3 of them are having trouble it's almost as though her husband has left her you can see nthe empty driveway through the window who could blame him 
 then there's a little boy trying to steal a bisuit out of a cupboard um by stabnding on a tall stoll and quite rightly this proves there is a god he's about to fall over and regret his crime forever meanwhile his sister i presume and she wants one of his biscuits  and if she doesn't look out she is going to be hit by the stool when the guy falls over
