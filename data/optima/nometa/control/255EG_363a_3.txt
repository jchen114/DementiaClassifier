  well we're in somebody's kitchen she's doing the washing up but she must be a bit.. thick because she's let this the the taps run and the sinks overflowing and she's standing in a pool of water and behind her her kids presumably hers are trying to raid the larder they've got the lid off and the little boy's pinching some cakes but he's standing on a stool and he's going to fall flat on his back in a minute
