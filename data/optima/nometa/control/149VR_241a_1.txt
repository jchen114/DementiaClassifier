 oh  mum is washing up ignoring the fact that the sink is overflowing ignoring the fact that the small boy is about to fall off his stool nicking cookies from the top shelf er i should think it's a one parent family 
 um well i mean the sink is obviously bunged up so dad hasn't been called upon to um unscrew the little gubbins under the sink and let the gunge out um she's way back because she would be wearing a pink jumpsuit if it was an up to date picture
 er it doesn't look like a council house because there's greenery outside that hasn't been torn to pieces and covered in litter er
 she hasn't got a draining board which is a bit daft
 no drawing done by a man
