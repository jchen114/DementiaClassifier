  Only too familiar the most horrible thing well the washing up she's left the tap running so it's running over boy is standing on a stool and he's pinching .. biscuits or cakes out of a tin and he shouldn't be and he's falling off the stool and the little girl doesn't want mother to hear so she's putting her finger up to her mouth
 Well mother's wiping up the dishes and she doesn't really hear what's going on she's getting wet  mother is obviously day-dreaming
 sh= she doesn't notice what's going on at all and the window's open presumably it's er sort of summer time because of  the things flourishing in the garden
