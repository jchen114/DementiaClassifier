 this is a picture where lots of dangerous things are happening a child shouldn't be on a stool because he could fall getting to a high cupboard to get biscuits out of the tin and the mother is looking out of the window and not concentrating and the water from the sink is too full and it's splashing over and going onto the floor where she could slip so that's very dangerous

 sorry about this
  um a boy and a girl are in the kitchen with their mother the mother is drying up and the children are getting biscuits out of the tin and handing them the boy is handing them down to the girl um there's quite a few problems here because the boy is on a stool a very high stool which he shouldn't be and it's tipping so he's going to fall on the floor the mother is looking down at the draining board not realising that the taps have overflowed the sink and it's going into the onto the floor just the fact that she could slide on it and have an accident tsch and the window is up very high so the children could get through that window
