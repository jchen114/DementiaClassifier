  .. well you've got a young boy taking cakes from a cupboard
  standing on a three-legged stool which is falling over
  er with a young girl standing next to him which is gonna receive the cakes that he's taking out
of the tin .. and .. you've got a woman washing up at the sink er or drying up at the sink
I should say er which has left the tap running and the water's overflowing onto the floor ..
um any more have i missed anything ? 
  and you've got an open window looking out onto a garden um with a garden path and shrubs
and a tree in the background
