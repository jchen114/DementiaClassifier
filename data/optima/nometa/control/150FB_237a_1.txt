 er mother's day dreaming
 washing the dishes she's left the tap running um the little boy's standing on a stool pinching cakes and the stool's tipping over um his little sister's holding up her hand because she wants one um day time .. er don't know what else .. she's obviously very preoccupied because she's not seeing what the kids are doing
  perhaps she's had a row with her husband
 well curtains are open
