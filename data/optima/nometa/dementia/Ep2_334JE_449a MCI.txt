well in one word chaos 
Um well the little boy boy's falling off the stool because he's trying to reach a a tin of biscuits in the cupboard and the little girl who's trying to help I think um mum doesn't look too worried about it and er the the sink it's overflowing with water um there's a house outside and there's a tree  .. with curtains there ..
and cupboards
