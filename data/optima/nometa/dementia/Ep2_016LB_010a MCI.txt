er the mother is washing up 
water's spilling over the sink 
the children are trying to get some cake by the look of it  
and they're falling off the stool
the girl is waiting for him to hand her
.. um the stool is falling over 
oh the curtain er drawn across the window you can see the corner of the hou= house next door 
and a path
