Chaos isn't it ? in parts  the mother presumably is gonna well in a dream
in the sink and that of course wouldn't happen because there'd be the overflow there
wouldn't it ?
Um er she's got a nice garden  what i can see  the er little girl is reaching up er
to be to receive something from the boy but he's moved too far so he's falling off the stool
.. have i said the si= sink is overflowing the dirty plates and things things there er
the boy's got a well he's pinching um a bun or a cake or a something er
.. i've said about the the stool
