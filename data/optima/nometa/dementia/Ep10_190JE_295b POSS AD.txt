it looks as though it's a kitchen
with a mother with an apron on and a dishcloth and she's s= water's pouring all over because the tap's been left running 
one little boy is on a stool the son and he's about to fall because he's it's about to trip over because he's stretching to steal s= stretching to get some cakes  
and the little girl is standing holding her hand up becauses she wants a taste from him
i don't think there's a= you could say any more unless you say the tap's running over
 said about the mother 
with the dishcloth and so forth
i worry terribly you see wh= what a position to be in he's clearly going to be very hurt if it falls back
