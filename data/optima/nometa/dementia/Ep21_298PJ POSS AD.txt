Yeah .. well a small boy is standing on a on on a on not a chair but a stool
which is tipping over under his weight and he's trying to grab some cakes from a tin
in the cupboard and a s= a little girl is obviously asking him for one of the cakes
with her hand out and the mother or it appears to be mother maybe it's only the maid is washing up
at the sink and the sink is overflowing and the window is half open
there's a view out into the garden and to the right on the sink there are two cups
and a plate and underneath or either side of the sink there are cupboards
