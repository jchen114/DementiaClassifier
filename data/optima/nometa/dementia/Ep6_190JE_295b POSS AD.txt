it's a kitchen with the window open you can see the garden outside the mother's at the sink letting the tap over run while she dries a plate but clearly not with it she's thinking of something else and there's a little girl and a little boy on a stool that's about to fall over because he's straining the stool by leaning up for the cakes the little girl's standing there holding her hand up for one it's a very nice kitchen with a beautiful outlook
