Well, it's a young mother washing up  she's  thoughts seem to be far away
because the sink is overflowing and the tap is on and the children are raiding the larder
and the boy is standing on a stool which is about to tipple over and the girl has her hand
out for a cake and the window is open  and there are two cups and a plate on the sink
