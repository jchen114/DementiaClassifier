well it's a tale of catastrophes this
um there's a boy and a girl who are feeling a bit peckish and they've opened a door to the in the kitchen where there's a er wait a minute er oh er cake 
 and at the moment of this the high s- s- s- stool he's standing on to this is um toppling over and his sister who I assume she is pays no attention to this and isn't going to bother about it at all 
the mother's just as bad she's sitting standing there thinking of other things while she's wiping up plate at the same time
mm and she's looking outside and the result of this is that she's left the plug in the sink and left the tap running and it's running all over water er the water's running all over the floor
