 what is
 oh i see right well we've got um a boy and a girl and the boy is pinching some cakes from the top of the cupboard and giving it giving them to the girl in doing so he's standing on a very tall stool which is falling over and he's going to crack his head in a minute um is that that you've got everything []
 all of the whole picture 
 um right the lady which i assume is mum [=laughs] um is washing up and at this stage she is wiping up and she hasn't noticed that the tap's running and it is running over onto the floor an= and her feet um behind the sink where that tap is er we can see the garden there's a path with a hedge there are some trees in the background there's a picture but er not a picture um a window behind the hedge er if i didn't say there's a path there is a path and there is presumably a lawn inside right round the window are a pair of curtains pulled back with what they used to call a [] er 
 there is a pelmet at the top um i can see a tree though the window i can see the roof of the building through the window um
