it's a wife washing up instead of me
and er looking out the window
and the water is overflowing in the sink 
the children are getting something out of the cupboard
and er the stool is tipping over his sister's waiting to help him eat the food
and er the view is into the garden 
and she's doing my job wi= wiping up
