and then there's a boy and a girl and he's climbed to the top of a um I don't know how you call those actually it's something rather high and round what do you call that it's
he's climbing on the stool and the stool is in the process of leaning over backwards and his sister either she's pushed him or she's trying to get hold of his head
er his hand
