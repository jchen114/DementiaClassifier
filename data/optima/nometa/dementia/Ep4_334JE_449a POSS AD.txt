well there's a bit of a catastrophe we'll start with the little boy who's falling off boy is it going to the cookie jar and he's standing on a stool and he's about to fall off and there's a little girl there 
um little girl i don't know she's I think she's reaching up for a cookie and the mum's sort of gazing out the window wi- wiping up and letting the washing up water .. go on the floor and there's a tree outside and there's bushes and next door's curtains and taps and taps and plates and cupboards
