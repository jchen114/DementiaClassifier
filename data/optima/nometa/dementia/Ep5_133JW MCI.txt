well we're in the kitchen and er it's it's a disaster happening
the sink's overflowing and she doesn't appear to notice although it's running
practically over her feet  er the window's open
the youngster  young lad is standing on a stool which is about to topple over
and he's trying to get the cakes out and his presumably younger sister there is
standing there waiting to receive and pass her bun
