P: kitchen chaos .. presumably the lady of the house is washing up she's letting the sink run over I don't know why she's drying things when the sink's running over but still then her dearly beloved offspring are trying to raid the larder and he's got on the stool and he's going to fall off.. anything else?

E: No can you see anything else? 

P: Well there's a garden there and the window's open 

E: Okay?

P: What else do you need?

E: That's fine that's.. great thank you
