P: starting from now
P: well it's
P: a scene in a kitchen and it is clearly showing everything that can go wrong it's warning against accidents the mother must be absolutely daft she's washing up and letting the water overflow right all over the floor which means that anybody could slip in it it's also wasting water i'm not quite certain whether the window is meant to be as open as that it's wide open anyone could get in there's a child reaching something which i'm sure he ought not to eat a cake out of a top shelf of a cupboard and his mother isn't noticing and he's falling over because he's standing on a high stool and is just about to have a very nasty fall rather untypically he's going to give one of the cakes to his sister 
P: i think that's about all
