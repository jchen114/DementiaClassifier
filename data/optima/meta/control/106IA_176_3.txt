P: um it's a kitchen and there's a girl washing up and she's turned the tap on in the sink and it's overflowing but she's too busy talking um there's a boy up on a stool and he has upset the stool as he's getting out some biscuits out of a tin giving them to his younger sister or whatever and the stool is going home and he's going to have a major fall and he's probably going to have a broken femur
