P: .. well the woman's supposed to be washing up but she's not taking much notice because she's got the tap full on and the sink's running over and um a little boy's up on the stool pinching the cookies and the stool's falling over and the little girl's holding out her hand to receive a cookie and um i think that's about all of interest
