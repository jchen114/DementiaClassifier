P: can i put my glasses on ?
P: right um there's a woman washing up and she's dreaming away so um the tap has run too far and it's overflowing and the water's going over the washing up and down onto the floor and she's in fact treading in it but she's um just just not aware she's somewhere else the window's open so it could be summer um a boy has climbed up to get some currant buns or something like that from a tin in the cupboard and is giving one to his sister but he's gone up on a three legged stool a very tall one and um he's lost his balance and is going to topple over backwards ..
