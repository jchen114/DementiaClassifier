P: somebody's busy er washing up and er lose their concentration 
P: leave the tap running and the sink overflows maybe it's because they are being distracted by the boy who's climbed up on a stool and is about to have an enormous crash because he's trying to steal something from the top shelf and a small girl is hoping to get something given her but she may not get it
