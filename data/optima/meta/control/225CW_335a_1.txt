P: er its a kitchen scene and a rather forgetful housewife er in being being busy washing up has let the water flow over the edge of the sink and forgotten to turn it off meanwhile the children behind her back are pinching the biscuits from the biscuit tin apart from the biscuits they seem a little short of food its obviously a nice sunny day because the windows open and view of the garden .. um

P: er so youd like me to describe it


P: um the lady is in a little dream world 


P: um shes actually drying the dishes but while shes doing that a whole host of unimaginable horrors are happening in the kitchen round about her um the sink is overflowing onto the floor um the children are attacking the biscuits from a very unsafe stool and their sons likely to have a broken leg any minute i should think er apart from the fact that theyre stealing the biscuits other than that theres nothing in the cupboard which means shes perhaps forgotten to go shopping um she herselfs going to slip on the water in a minute yeah
