P: um it's a mother doing the washing up but she seems to have gone into a dream and the tap is overflowing onto the floor and she's more or less don't think she's treading in the puddle but she may she is drying a dish perhaps looking into space a bit um and now the boy has got up onto the stool but and he's getting something out of a tin for his sister but the stool is about to fall over and his sister is reaching up for bun or apple and the boy doesn't seem at all worried that he's his stool is um tipping over backwards
