P: .. have i to describe the whole of this picture ?
P: um this is er a kitchen which um has a window looking out onto a garden with curtains er theres a lady washing up or drying something um the lady is wearing a pinafore I think and to that extent she looks careful of her work but in every other detail er she looks extremely careless um shes allowing the water to overflow  from her sink um without apparently noticing it um the draining board has a couple of cups and a plate upon it um she is also er in ignorance of the fact that two of her children are um .. stealing buns from a cupboard behind her er the boy is passing buns down to the girl the boy is on a stool which is on the point of collapsing and um it appears to me that its a great deal of tragedy going to happen in a very short time in the whole of this situation
