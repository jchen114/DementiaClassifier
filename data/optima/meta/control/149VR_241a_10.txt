P: oh yes i remember this picture um reading from the left there is a horrid little girl encouraging her brother to behave like an idiot stealing cakes and making hushing noises er there's not much point in her making hushing noises because the lad is standing on a stool which is tipped beyond the point of no return so he's going to fall crashing down um and probably bring the cake tin with him and the  rests her mind back from the milkman who's just gone off to the garden path and er probably thumped both children um the milkman must have been very attractive because the sink is overflowing and she's holding a plate as if she's oh dear as if it was a bottle of milk um the garden looks reasonably tidy um the draining board worktops look much too tidy for a household with two children and a feckless mother um don't think she's cross-eyed I think it's the drawing how much more would you like to know?
