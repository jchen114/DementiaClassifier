P: Alright



P: It looks to me like a kitchen where a young woman er is washing up she's er the elder sister or possibly the mother of two children a boy and a girl the boy is standing on a stool trying to get some of what look like cakes out of a cupboard but he's falling over and the stool is toppling over and he's about to hand one of them down to er the girl who might be his sister the woman who's washing up is rather surprisingly paying no attention to the fact that the taps are running and the sink is er overflowing er she looks as if she's dreaming about something um she's drying a plate while washing up she's actually drying a plate


P: Um


P: I can't see much else happening
