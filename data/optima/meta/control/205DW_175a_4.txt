P: ah well starting on the left there's a small boy stealing um what look like mince pies off a remarkably badly balanced stool and probably feeding them to his sister there's someone er doing the washing up but has allowed the tap to run and is spilling on the floor er this is a view of the garden um i think that's about all that's worth saying
