P: the whole picture? 
P: right well the boy on the left is is standing on a stool which he is now falling stealing or getting some cakes to give to the girl with him. Same time the woman on the right is not noticing it and she's also not w= noticing she's doing the washing up that the basin is full splashing water all around her feet and she's busy drying the plate as though nothing is happening there's a garden outside and the curtains are pulled and the dishes are on here
