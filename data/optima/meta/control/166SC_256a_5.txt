P: there's a lady doing the washing up she has a dish towel in her hand and a plate and she's quite oblivious of the fact that the sink is overflowing all over the floor er the window is open and er there's a garden beyond with some bushes and path er beside the sink there are two cups and another plate there's a boy climbing up onto a stool which is overturning and he's pinching some er cookies or something from a tin in a cupboard and there's a girl beside him who's looks as if she's telling him to be quite about it
