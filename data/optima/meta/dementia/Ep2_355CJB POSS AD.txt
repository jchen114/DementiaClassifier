Well it it looks as though a mother is is um doing doing the washing
and she's not paying attention because the sink is overflowing which would
wouldn't really happen 
er the boy is trying to skim some biscuits er and he's falling off off the stool
and the girl is er reaching up for the cakes .. but she wouldn't get them
.. um and  the window's out  there and that's  the garden there
perhaps  the mother ah couldn't do anything to turn the 
every bowl's there presumably um get her feet feet wet
i think it's  to the cupboard and kitchen
