Well , it's  the mother's back is turned as to washing up she her mind must be wandering
because the sink is overflowing  she hasn't turned the tap off and the children
are raiding a cupboard while her back's turned and pinching some food
and outside in the garden?
 the boy  the stool he's on i= is tippling over
er i did say that he's pinching food from the cupboard ?
and handing it to his sister presumably
