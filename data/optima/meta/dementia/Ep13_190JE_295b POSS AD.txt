it's a kitchen 
with a mother at the sink drying the dishes but the water is running over because she hasn't turned the taps off properly the window's open  um then more her with a child off a stool that's about to fall so he's  and he's taking cakes out of a cake tin and the little girl his sister is um just about to take a cake from him and the chair is tipping up so in a minute or two he's going to fall to the ground um a nice garden outside bushes  and that's a very nice kitchen actually it's pleasant isn't it
