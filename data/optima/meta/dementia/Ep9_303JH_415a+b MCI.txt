er the boy's getting biscuits out of a tin in the cupboard um and his sister is holding her hand out for one of them .. and or maybe that's to the line of stool's falling over .. which will I think bring mother out of her daydream now she's standing there  standing at desk sink which is flowing over on to the floor .. looking in the garden looks surreal
