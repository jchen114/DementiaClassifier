we're in a kitchen 
and the tap is running over the mother is standing by the tap letting it run over while she she dries a plate
very pretty outlook onto a garden 
a little boy climbing a stool to get some cakes from the cupboard but he's because the the stool is tipping over it's become unbalanced 
the little girl nevertheless has got her hand out for him to hand her a biscuit or cake or whatever it is um there are three cupboards one two three four five six lower cupboards in this picture and there's a nice garden outside of the with two very nice blinds in the kitchen
