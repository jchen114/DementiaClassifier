  washing  /. 
washing dishes or wiping dishes.  
the water's running over the sink.
the kid is stealing the cookies.
uh he's falling over on the stool.
the wind is blowing outside the window.
uh the girl is  is uh saying “be quiet” and looking for another cookie.
she is like Eve encouraging him to steal them youknow.
uh she's standing in a puddle.
she's thinking deeply about something I don't know what.
that's about all I see.
