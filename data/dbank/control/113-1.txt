mm the little girl is asking for a cookie.
little boy is handing her a cookie and taking a cookie and falling off the chair  .
mother's washing dishes.
the water's running.
it's falling on the floor.
and she's standing in it.
uh the wind is blowing.
the curtains are ruffled.
the mother's smiling.
she must be deaf not to see what's going on behind her too . 
it's summertime.
flower  er the plants are in bloom outside.
that's all I see.
