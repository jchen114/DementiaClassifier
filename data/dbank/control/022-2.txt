oh goody. 
that boy's climbed on a stool that's falling over to get a cookie.
and the little girl is standing below him trying to get the cookie from his hand.
and the mother is washing dishes while the water's running over in the sink on the floor.
and the window is  the sun's shining .
there's two cups and this plate on the counter.
and maybe the mother is drying a plate.
that's all I see.
