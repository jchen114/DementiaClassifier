d å  boy is standing on a stool and he is slipping.
and he is reaching into the cookie jar to take cookies out for him and his sister who has her hand out reaching for a cookie.
she's standing there beside him.
the door of the cabinet is open.
mother is standing at the sink drying a dish.
water is overflowing onto the floor.
there are cups and saucers on the counter.
the window is open.

the curtains look as if they are fluttering.
there is a tree and a walk.
and mother has her back to the youngsters. 
I don't believe she knows what is going on.
