okay. 
the boy is taking cookies out of a closet with one hand trying to give the cookies to his sister with another . while he is falling off a three  three prong stool.
his mother is washing dishes.
and the dishwasher is overflowing onto the floor.
and the curtains are billowing.
and the girl is eating . or toying.
it's difficult to tell. 
that's the only action I see.
