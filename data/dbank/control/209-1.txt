okay the boy in the process of stealing cookies from the jar uh is about to fall from the stool.
uh his sister I think is admonishing him to be quiet.
the mother is drying dishes.
at the point she's drying dishes the water  perhaps from the noise the water is spilling over the sink and onto the floor.
okay ?  
um dishes spilling. 
the mother is frowning which is a form of action I would think you would say.
and that's it.
