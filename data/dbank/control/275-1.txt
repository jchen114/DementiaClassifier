the girl's reaching for them.
she's apparently telling him to be quiet.
he's falling off the stool.
uh mom's washing dishes while the water runs  out over the sink.
um looks like the curtain might be blowing a little bit there.
uh . and she's stepping out of the puddle.
um .. I guess that's about it.
