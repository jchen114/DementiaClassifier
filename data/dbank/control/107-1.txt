. boy's falling off a stool.  
the lid is falling off a cookie jar.
he's grabbing a cookie in his hand.
the girl is reaching up.
she's touching her nose. 
. 
the other side, the mother's washing dishes.  
the sink is running over.
. her feet's  getting wet . as she's looking out the window. 
that'd be pretty difficult to look out the window and get your feet getting wet at the same time but that's what it is. 
okay.
