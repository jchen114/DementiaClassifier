uh going on or everything that I see whether it's going on or not ?  
okay. 
well mama's washing the dishes and the sink's running over.
and uh one of the youngsters is about to fall off a stool.
he's reaching in for the cookie jar and handing them to his sister who's got her finger at her nose for some reason.
uh . mom's feet are getting wet because of the sink running over.
I don't see anything outside that's going on.
  it's just normal.
okay ?
