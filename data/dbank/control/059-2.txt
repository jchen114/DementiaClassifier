all the action. 
mother is drying dishes and the tap water is overflowing the sink and running on the floor.
and Johnny's trying to get some cookies.
and his step stool is falling.
and little girl is reaching her hand up for a cookie and putting her hand to her mouth.
oh  oh well, that's what's happening. 
I don't know. 
mother's stepping I mean  the lady's stepping in the water that spilled on the floor.
that's all I can be sure of.
