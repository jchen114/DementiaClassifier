well my goodness here !  
little boy's about to fall off a chair   while he's reaching for some cookies.  
and he's handing some cookies to his sister apparently.
and the mother o is over here.
probably the mother. 
wiping a plate. 
filling dishes. 
and meanwhile the water's overflowing out of the sink and dropping on the floor and she's standing in water.
which doesn't make sense, does it ?   
I don't see any birds on the windowsills.
no action outside so that looks like that's about all the action. 
girl's reaching up for a cookie. 
she's got her finger up her nose or to  touching her nose for some reason.
can't tell if the grass is growing sorry. 
  no  no.
