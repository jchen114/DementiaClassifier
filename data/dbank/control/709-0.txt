okay. 
well in the first place the  m the mother forgot to turn off the water and the water's running out the sink.
and sh she's standing there .
it's falling on the floor.
the child is got a stool and reaching up into the cookie jar. 
and the  stool is tipping over.
and he's sorta  put down the plates. 
and she's reaching up to get it but I don't see anything wrong with  her though.
yeah that's it. 
I can't see anything.
