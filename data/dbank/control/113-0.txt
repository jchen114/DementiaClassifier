. the little girl's pointing to her mouth.
she wants a cookie.
the little boy is getting cookies and he's about to fall off his stool.
the mother's washing dishes.
she's wiping a plate.
the faucet is running.
the sink is running over.
the water is running on the floor.
um the curtains are blowing.
.. so there has to be a breeze outside .
that's all I can see.
