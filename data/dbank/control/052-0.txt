a boy is taking uh  cookies from the cookie jar giving one to his sister.
he's also falling off the stool he is on.
the mother is washing dishes.
she's letting the sink overflow.
it's getting all over the floor.
I see nothing further. 
... the girl is saying be quiet if that  if that counts.
I don't know what the mother gets by standing in all the water. 
I don't think that's very important. 
that's all I see. 
  what have  what have I missed ?
