well the mother's washing the dishes.
the water's running out of the sink.
.. the um boy is . falling off the stool . while he takes the cookie out of the cookie jar.
the girl is gesturing . for him to be quiet.
. the woman's standing in water.
she's looking out of the window, drying the dish.
.. the . lid is off the cookie jar whether that means anything.
I think that's all I can see in there.
