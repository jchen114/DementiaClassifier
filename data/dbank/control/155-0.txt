well I see the sink overflowing.
the mother is doing the dishes.
the children are  the boy is up on the s stool.
and the stool's falling over but he's grabbing cookies out of the cookie jar.
and the girl is reaching up for a cookie.
the window seems to be open .
and the woman is standing in water.
and the cookie jar lid is off  falling off.
the water's running.
