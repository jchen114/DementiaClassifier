well let's see. 
we have the water coming out of the spigot and the sink is stopped up and the water is going on the floor.
apparently the mother is drying a dish.
we have the boy standing on a stool trying to get cookies out of the cookie jar and handing them to  uh handing them to his sister probably.
and he's about to fall as the stool is tipping over.
and the grass is growing and  uh probably.
but I guess that's about the action.
