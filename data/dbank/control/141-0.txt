the action only ?  
okay. 
let's see. 
there's uh a boy and a girl.
the boy is getting cookies from the jar and he is on a stool.
and the stall   is tilted over.
a catastrophe there I can see.
the mother is drying dishes and has the water turned on.
and her mind must be elsewhere  because the water has overflowed.
and . I don't see anything happening outside.
that's  that's just about it I think.
