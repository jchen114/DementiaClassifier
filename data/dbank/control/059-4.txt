oh there's a little boy on a s la um  step stool about to fall.
he's reaching in the cookie jar.
and the little girl reaching for a cookie.
and the mother washing dishes .
and the sink is overflowing.
and the tap water's coming in.
and it looks like there might be a breeze blowing the curtains.
because the water's running on the floor .  
hm  ...  
and the door of the cupboard is ajar . where he has a cookie jar hm.
