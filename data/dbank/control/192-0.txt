well the mother's washing the dishes.
and the boy is reaching for cookies and he's falling off the chair  .
and the little girl's laughing at him of  I think.
and the water's spilling over onto the floor.
 . 
.. I can't see any other action. 
. I guess she's drying her dishes not washing them.
she's doing something with them.
