the boy is giving his sister a cookie.
and the s stool is about to fall.
and the mother's drying dishes.
and the water's coming out of the faucet.
and the water's overflowing out of the sink onto the floor.
and the little girl is putting her hand up to her mouth to s signal not to say anything so the mother won't know about it.
that's all.
