little boy getting in the cookie jar.  
and the little girl holding out her hand for some cookies.
and a stool the boy is on is about to tip over.  
and a lady is drying a dish.
and the water is running over overflowing from the sink.
uh you said just the action ?  
  the lady is stepping in the water on the floor.
hm I don't know what's going on outside the window.
