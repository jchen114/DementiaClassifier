well let's see . 
the children are getting cookies.
and the stool is going to fall.
the sink is overflowing.
the mother's washing or  drying dishes.
um . the girl is putting her finger up to her mouth.
like I said the mother doesn't know they took the lid off the cookie jar. 
they opened the door.
and . that's all I can see.
