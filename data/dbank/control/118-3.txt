uh ha there's a little boy's taking a cookie out of the c cookie jar and giving it to his sister.
and the  the stool that he's standing on is gonna  fall.
and the  the mother's back is turned.
and she's the water is overflowing in the sink.
and uh she's wiping the dish.
and uh . the  wi the window's open.
and she's probably looking out the window and missing the water f overflowing.
