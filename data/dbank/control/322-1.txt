action type things ?  
there is water coming out of a faucet into a basin which is overflowing onto the floor.
the mother is drying dishes.
and she's walking in the water that is flowing on the floor.
two children are stealing cookies.
one of whom is up on a uh stool that is about to fall.  
he's removing cookies from an upper shelf in the closet.
the wind appears to be blowing because the curtains appear to be youknow puffed.
those are the only action things that I can see.
