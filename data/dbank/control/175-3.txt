the woman is drying the dishes and the w sink is overflowing.
the boy's getting the cookies out of the cookie jar.
and the stool's about to tip over.
and the girl's telling him to be quiet .
uh it's a warm sunny day because the window is open.
and she looks like she's sortof in a  in a daze and doesn't quite know what's going on.
could be daydreaming or daft, one or the other.  
is that it ?
