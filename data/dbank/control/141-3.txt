well the little girl is saying to be quiet to her brother.
and her brother's in the cookie jar and he's falling off the chair  .
the mother's oblivious to all.
she's washing her dishes and the water's coming out of her sink.
I don't know what she's thinking of. 
um let's see what we have. 
anything outside ?  
. I guess those are bushes.
I don't know. 
okay. 
nothing out there. 
these are okay. 
the dishes are okay.
let's see. 
how are their shoes ?  
their socks are alright.
I don't know.
