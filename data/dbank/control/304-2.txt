the water is running out of the sink.
and the kid's falling off of the stool.
he's k stealing some cookies.
and the little girl says “don't tell your mother” who is standing in the water  and r drying dishes.
uh washing dishes I guess maybe drying them I don't know.  
and uh guess the water's splashing all over the floor.
that kid don't fall out  fall off that stool he's gonna  break his neck. 
and getting the cookies. 
that's about all I can see.
