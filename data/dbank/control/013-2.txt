a boy is getting cookies out of the cookie jar.
he's standing on a stool that's gonna  fall.
the girl is reaching for a cookie.
the mother's drying dishes.
the faucet's running water.
it's dripping out of the sink.
um . spilling onto the floor. 
dishes are on the uh counter.
window is open. 
must be summertime. 
the girl is laughing.
looks like she's laughing.
that's about it.
