mhm. 
 the little boy is reaching for a cookie.
and he's falling at the same time because the stool has tipped over.
his little sister is reaching for a cookie and I think beginning to laugh because he's falling.
the sink is running over and dripping water on the floor while the mother is trying to dry the dishes.
um the window is open and the curtains are blowing in the breeze coming in from outside.
the water is running in the sink.
that's why it's overflowing.
.. I also believe that the mother is daydreaming.
. possibly worrying about uh something.  
that's it. 
that's all I see.
