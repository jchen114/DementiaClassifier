I see a little boy on a stool trying to reach the cookie jar.
he's got one in his hand that to his little sister. 
and the stool is falling over tipping.
and the lady is  guess mama is standing by the sink washing dishes.
and the water's running over on the floor.
and outside you can see the walk and the shrubbery.
and there's some dishes setting on the counter.
and that's all I see.
