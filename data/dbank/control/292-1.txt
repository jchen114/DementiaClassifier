girl is reaching up. 
the boy is  is uh taking cookies out of the cookie jar.
uh the uh stool is tilting.
mother is washing the dishes.
the water's running over.
the wind is blowing the uh curtains.
. the mother is drying the dishes.
the boy is reaching down to I guess his sister.
the boy is climbing but he's gonna  fall.
. and the mother's drying the dishes.
I think I said that. 
the water's running and running down.
and that's all I see on that.
