alright. 
the young man is stealing from the  c trying to get cookies from the cookie jar.
and she's standing laughing at him and he's falling over.
and uh mama had an accident at the kitchen sink.
either she's daydreaming or something wiping uh uh a dish.
and that is overflowing the sink onto the floor and onto her feet.
and uh the window is open.
and there are two cups and a dish on the counter.
what else do you want me to tell you ?  
Imean what did you want me to say ?  
  what was it again ?  
anything that's happening ?  
  oh. 
um well the window is open.
I guess there's a breeze blowing but uh that's about all I can see actually happening.
very good.
