oh I see a woman drying a dish with a dish towel.
I see water overflowing from the sink.
the faucet is running.
um curtains hanging on the wall. 
the window, the picture outside of a pathway and grass and hedges and looks like a part of the extension of the house. 
I see the cabinets below her.
she's wearing shoes dress and apron.
um I see the cabinets on the far end of the wall with two children.
a stool tilting with a boy on it reaching for cookies from a cookie jar on the shelf.
I see the girl reaching up to him with the motion of silence to her mouth her fingers up to her lips and standing as the stool is um tilting.
the cupboard door is open.
the bottom doors of the cabinets are closed. 
um the woman is standing in water on the floor from the spilling.
there's handles um uh that I can see on two sets of cabinets.
uh the curtains are tied back by a tie.
on the counter are two cups and a plate.
there's two faucets and a spout.
