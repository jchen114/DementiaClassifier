. well the lady's drying her dishes.
that  the little boy's up on a ladder reaching for cookie jar . 
and the little girl's down on the floor reaching up toward him.
then I see a sink, the dishes, cupboard. 
and then there's a walkway in the back.
guess  I guess that's a walkway I call.  
the water's running over the sink .
well I said the little boy's climbing up on the cookie  j for the cookies.
