well the little kid's falling off his chair  . 
and the mother is having water run over the uh sink.
well the water's running on the floor  /. 
 , under her feet.
I'm looking outside but that yard is okay.
the windows are open.
the little girl is laughing at the boy falling off the chair   .
that  that's bad .
