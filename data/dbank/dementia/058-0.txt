okay. 
the mother is washing dishes.
and the water is flowing from the sink.
she's looking out the window.
the uh son or the boy's on a stool which he's about to fall off stealing cookies from the cookie jar and giving it to probably his little sister.
there are uh two cups and a dish on the sink counter.
and the lady at the sink has a dish and a wash  and a dry cloth.
do you want me to describe her clothes ?  
oh.
