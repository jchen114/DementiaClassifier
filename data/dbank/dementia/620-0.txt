little boy's stealing cookies out of the cookie jar. 
little girl's whispering not to tell. 
his chair's   gonna  fall.
his mother's at the sink washing dishes.
she's spilled the water all over.
it's running all over the floor.
she's drying a plate.
she's uh looking out the window.
the little boy's stool's gonna  fall.
he's got a cookie in his hand.
he's reaching for a second one.
the mother she's looking outside and not watching the water running over from the sink.
the cupboard door is open.
she shouldn't be looking out the window.
she's washing dishes.
she's letting the water run out.
I don't know what else I could tell.
