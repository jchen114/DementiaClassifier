oh the water is running out of the sink.
mother is calmly drying a dish.
the uh stool is going to fall over and the little boy is on top of it uh getting in the cookie jar.
and the little girl is uh reaching for a cookie.
she has her hands to her  her finger to her lip as if she's telling the boy not to tell.
the curtains seem to be waving a bit.
the water's running.
. and it's splashing on the floor.
that's it.
