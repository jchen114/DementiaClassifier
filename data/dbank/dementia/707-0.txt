hm. 
the little boy is on the stool which is tipping and he wants cookies to give to his sister.
he has a handful of cookies in one hand already and the little girl is eating a cookie.
the mother is washing dishes absentmindedly. 
she let the sink run over and it's all on the floor.
there's a window with   you can see their driveway. 
either bushes or trees and grass a big window. 
and a tree coming up here. 
and the  roo part of the roof. 
and the cookie says cookie jar.
