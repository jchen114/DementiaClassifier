that's it. 
well the girl's drying the  the plate.
and she's overflowing the water in the  sink.
there's a boy up on a stool and he's falling off of it.
trying to get a cake or something. 
.. in the cupboard. 
see he's trying to get this and he's gonna  fall off of there.  
  so  ... 
and the mother's water's all coming down out of her  sink there.
the little girl is putting her hand up to the boy.
they're gonna  get something out of that jar, a pineapple jar or something.
