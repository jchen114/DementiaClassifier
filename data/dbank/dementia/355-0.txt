and the boy is getting cookies out of a jar.
and he's on a stool.
and there's cups over here.
and the water's going on the floor.
and the housewife, the mother, is wiping the dishes.
and she's standing by the window.
and uh she's letting the water run out of the faucet onto the floor.
and the  k the ladder is falling over when he's getting the cookies out.
