okay we see um first of all uh the sink is overflowing.
water cascading down the uh kitchen cabinet onto the floor. 
uh the lady in the picture is drying a dish.
uh there is a young man on a stool.
and he's  the stool is being tipped over.
he's reaching for a cookie jar.
uh the lid is off the jar and it looks like he's going to try to hand a cookie down to his little sister.
and uh looks like he might make it before he hits the floor.
I don't think so.
